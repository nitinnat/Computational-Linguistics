There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers
exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will
instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more
bizarre and inexplicable.
There is another theory which states that this has already
happened.
In the beginning the Universe was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded
as a bad move.
Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God,
though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle believe that the
entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being
called the Great Green Arkleseizure.
The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they
call The Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue
creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore
unique in being the only race in history to have invented the
aerosol deodorant before the wheel.
However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely
accepted outside Viltvodle and so, the Universe being the
puzzling place it is, other explanations are constantly being
sought.
For instance, a race of hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings
once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep
Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the Ultimate
Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and
calculated, and in the end announced that the answer was in fact
Forty-two - and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built
to find out what the actual question was.
And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that
it was frequently mistaken for a planet - especially by the
strange ape-like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware
that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program.
And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and
obvious piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the
Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense.
Sadly however, just before the critical moment of readout, the
Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way - so
they claimed - for a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of
discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever.
Or so it would seem.
Two of there strange, ape-like creatures survived.
Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend
of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small
planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he
had hitherto claimed; and, more to the point, he knew how to
hitch rides on flying saucers.
Tricia McMillian - or Trillian - had skipped the planet six
months earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the
Galaxy.
Two survivors.
They are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever
conducted - to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer
of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is
drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship
is moving slowly towards them.
Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much
designed as congealed. The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices
which protuded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured
the looks of most ships, but in this case that was sadly
impossible. Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not
by reliable witnesses.
In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you would
have to go inside and look at a Vogon. If you are wise, however,
this is precisely what you will avoid doing because the average
Vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly
hideous to you that you will wish you had never been born - or
(if you are a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never
been born.
In fact, the average Vogon probably wouldn't even think once.
They are simple-minded, thick-willed, slug-brained creatures, and
thinking is not really something they are cut out for. Anatomical
analysis of the Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a
badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver. The fairest thing
you can say about them, then, is that they know what they like,
and what they like generally involves hurting people and,
wherever possible, getting very angry.
One thing they don't like is leaving a job unfinished -
particularly this Vogon, and particularly - for various reasons -
this job.
This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic
Hyperspace Planning Council, and he was it who had had the job of
demolishing the so-called "planet" Earth.
He heaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill-fitting,
slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship
Heart of Gold was being systematically scanned.
It mattered little to him that the Heart of Gold, with its
Infinite Improbability Drive, was the most beautiful and
revolutionary ship ever built. Aesthetics and technology were
closed books to him and, had he had his way, burnt and buried
books as well.
It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox was aboard.
Zaphod Beeblebrox was now the ex-President of the Galaxy, and
though every police force in the Galaxy was currently pursuing
both him and this ship he had stolen, the Vogon was not
interested.
He had other fish to fry.
It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and
corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds,
and this was certainly true in his case. When he heard the words
"integrity" or "moral rectitude", he reached for his dictionary,
and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he
reached for the rule book and threw it away.
In seeking so implacably the destruction of the Earth and all
that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call
of his professional duty. There was even some doubt as to whether
the said bypass was actually going to be built, but the matter
had been glossed over.
He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction.
"Computer," he croaked, "get me my brain care specialist on the
line."
Within a few seconds the face of Gag Halfrunt appeared on the
screen, smiling the smile of a man who knew he was ten light
years away from the Vogon face he was looking at. Mixed up
somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too. Though the Vogon
persistently referred to him as "my private brain care
specialist" there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it
was in fact Halfrunt who was employing the Vogon. He was paying
him an awful lot of money to do some very dirty work. As one of
the Galaxy's most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he and
a consortium of his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an
awful lot of money when it seemed that the entire future of
psychiatry might be at stake.
"Well," he said, "hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and how
are we feeling today?"
The Vogon captain told him that in the last few hours he had
wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise.
Halfrunt's smile did not flicker for an instant.
"Well," he said, "I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for
a Vogon, you know? The natural and healthy channelling of the
aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence."
"That," rumbled the Vogon, "is what you always say."
"Well again," said Halfrunt, "I think that this is perfectly
normal behaviour for a psychiatrist. Good. We are clearly both
very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today. Now tell me,
what news of the mission?"
"We have located the ship."
"Wonderful," said Halfrunt, "wonderful! and the occupants?"
"The Earthman is there."
"Excellent! And ...?"
"A female from the same planet. They are the last."
"Good, good," beamed Halfrunt, "Who else?"
"The man Prefect."
"Yes?"
"And Zaphod Beeblebrox."
For an instant Halfrunt's smile flickered.
"Ah yes," he said, "I had been expecting this. It is most
regrettable."
"A personal friend?" inquired the Vogon, who had heard the
expression somewhere once and decided to try it out.
"Ah, no," said Halfrunt, "in my profession you know, we do not
make personal friends."
"Ah," grunted the Vogon, "professional detachment."
"No," said Halfrunt cheerfully, "we just don't have the knack."
He paused. His mouth continued to smile, but his eyes frowned
slightly.
"But Beeblebrox, you know," he said, "he is one of my most
profitable clients. He had personality problems beyond the dreams
of analysts."
He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing
it.
"Still," he said, "you are ready for your task?"
"Yes."
"Good. Destroy the ship immediately."
"What about Beeblebrox?"
"Well," said Halfrunt brightly, "Zaphod's just this guy, you
know?"
He vanished from the screen.
The Vogon Captain pressed a communicator button which connected
him with the remains of his crew.
"Attack," he said.
At that precise moment Zaphod Beeblebrox was in his cabin
swearing very loudly. Two hours ago, he had said that they would
go for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe,
whereupon he had had a blazing row with the ship's computer and
stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out the
Improbability factors with a pencil.
The Heart of Gold's Improbability Drive made it the most powerful
and unpredictable ship in existence. There was nothing it
couldn't do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that
the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen.
He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching
it. He didn't know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he
liked it.
He didn't know why he had become President of the Galaxy, except
that it seemed a fun thing to be.
He did know that there were better reasons than these, but that
they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains.
He wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go
away because they occasionally surfaced momentarily and put
strange thoughts into the light, fun sections of his mind and
tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business
of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time.
At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time. He had
run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry.
"Starpox!" he shouted.
At that same precise moment, Ford Prefect was in mid air. This
was not because of anything wrong with the ship's artificial
gravity field, but because he was leaping down the stair-well
which led to the ship's personal cabins. It was a very high jump
to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled, recovered,
raced down the corridor sending a couple of miniature service
robots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod's door
and explained what was on his mind.
"Vogons," he said.
A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin
in search of a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon
with a great deal of optimism., because he knew that the only
source of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of
equipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. It was
called a Nutri-Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered
it before.
It claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks
personally matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared
to use it. When put to the test, however, it invariably produced
a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but nit
quite, entirely unlike tea.
He attempted to reason with the thing.
"Tea," he said.
"Share and Enjoy," the machine replied and provided him with yet
another cup of the sickly liquid.
He threw it away.
"Share and enjoy," the machine repeated and provided him with
another one.
"Share and Enjoy" is the company motto of the hugely successful
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints division, which now
covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is
the only part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent
profit in recent years.
The motto stands - or rather stood - in three mile high
illuminated letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on
Eadrax. Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it
was erected, the ground beneath the letters caved in and they
dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many
talented young complaints executives - now deceased.
The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the
local language, to read "Go stick your head in a pig", and are no
longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration.
Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid.
"Listen, you machine," he said, "you claim you can synthesize any
drink in existence, so why do you keep giving me the same
undrinkable stuff?"
"Nutrition and pleasurable sense data," burbled the machine.
"Share and Enjoy."
"It tastes filthy!"
"If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink," continued the
machine, "why not share it with your friends?"
"Because," said Arthur tartly, "I want to keep them. Will you try
to comprehend what I'm telling you? That drink ..."
"That drink," said the machine sweetly, "was individually
tailored to meet your personal requirements for nutrition and
pleasure."
"Ah," said Arthur, "so I'm a masochist on diet am I?"
"Share and Enjoy."
"Oh shut up."
"Will that be all?"
Arthur decided to give up.
"Yes," he said.
Then he decided he'd be dammed if he'd give up.
"No," he said, "look, it's very, very simple ... all I want ...
is a cup of tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and
listen."
And he sat. He told the Nutri-Matic about India, he told it about
China, he told it about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves
drying in the sun. He told it about silver teapots. He told it
about summer afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting in
the milk before the tea so it wouldn't get scalded. He even told
it (briefly) about the history of the East India Company.
"So that's it, is it?" said the Nutri-Matic when he had finished.
"Yes," said Arthur, "that is what I want."
"You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?"
"Er, yes. With milk."
"Squirted out of a cow?"
"Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose ..."
"I'm going to need some help with this one," said the machine
tersely. All the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice
and it now meant business.
"Well, anything I can do," said Arthur.
"You've done quite enough," the Nutri-Matic informed him.
It summoned up the ship's computer.
"Hi there!" said the ship's computer.
The Nutri-Matic explained about tea to the ship's computer. The
computer boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri-Matic and
together they lapsed into a grim silence.
Arthur watched and waited for a while, but nothing further
happened.
He thumped it, but still nothing happened.
Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge.
In the empty wastes of space, the Heart of Gold hung still.
Around it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy. Towards it
crept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship.
"Does anyone have a kettle?" Arthur asked as he walked on to the
bridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at
the computer to talk to her, Ford was thumping it and Zaphod was
kicking it, and also why there was a nasty yellow lump on the
vision screen.
He put down the empty cup he was carrying and walked over to
them.
"Hello?" he said.
At that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the polished marble
surfaces that contained the instruments that controlled the
conventional photon drive. They materialized beneath his hands
and he flipped over to manual control. He pushed, he pulled, he
pressed and he swore. The photon drive gave a sickly judder and
cut out again.
"Something up?" said Arthur.
"Hey, didja hear that?" muttered Zaphod as he leapt now for the
manual controls of the Infinite Improbability Drive, "the monkey
spoke!"
The Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then also cut
out.
"Pure history, man," said Zaphod, kicking the Improbability
Drive, "a talking monkey!"
"If you're upset about something ..." said Arthur.
"Vogons!" snapped Ford, "we're under attack!"
Arthur gibbered.
"Well what are you doing? Let's get out of here!"
"Can't. Computer's jammed."
"Jammed?"
"It says all its circuits are occupied. There's no power anywhere
in the ship."
Ford moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve across
his forehead and slumped back against the wall.
"Nothing we can do," he said. He glared at nothing and bit his
lip.
When Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the Earth had
been demolished, he had used to play football. He had not been at
all good at it, and his particular speciality had been scoring
own goals in important matches. Whenever this happened he used to
experience a peculiar tingling round the back of his neck that
would slowly creep up across his cheeks and heat his brow. The
image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering boys flinging
it at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment.
A peculiar tingling sensation at the back of his neck was
creeping up across his cheeks and heating his brow.
He started to speak, and stopped.
He started to speak again and stopped again.
Finally he managed to speak.
"Er," he said. He cleared his throat.
"Tell me," he continued, and said it so nervously that the others
all turned to stare at him. He glanced at the approaching yellow
blob on the vision screen.
"Tell me," he said again, "did the computer say what was
occupying it? I just ask out of interest ..."
Their eyes were riveted on him.
"And, er ... well that's it really, just asking."
Zaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck.
"What have you done to it, Monkeyman?" he breathed.
"Well," said Arthur, "nothing in fact. It's just that I think a
short while ago it was trying to work out how to ..."
"Yes?"
"Make me some tea."
"That's right guys," the computer sang out suddenly, "just coping
with that problem right now, and wow, it's a biggy. Be with you
in a while." It lapsed back into a silence that was only matched
for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at
Arthur Dent.
As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to
start firing.
The ship shook, the ship thundered. Outside, the inch thick
force-shield around it blistered, crackled and spat under the
barrage of a dozen -Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon, and
looked as if it wouldn't be around for long. Four minutes is how
long Ford Prefect gave it."Three minutes and fifty seconds," he
said a short while later.
"Forty-five seconds," he added at the appropriate time. He
flicked idly at some useless switches, then gave Arthur an
unfriendly look.
"Dying for a cup of tea, eh?" he said. "Three minutes and forty
seconds."
"Will you stop counting!" snarled Zaphod.
"Yes," said Ford Prefect, "in three minutes and thirty-five
seconds."
Aboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was puzzled. He had
expected a chase, he had expected an exciting grapple with
tractor beams, he had expected to have to use the specially
installed Sub-Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron to counter the Heart
of Gold's Infinite Improbability Drive, but the Sub-Cyclic
Normality Assert-i-Tron lay idle as the Heart of Gold just sat
there and took it.
A dozen -Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon continued to
blaze away at the Heart of Gold, and still it just sat there and
took it.
He tested every sensor at his disposal to see if there was any
subtle trickery afoot, but no subtle trickery was to be found.
He didn't know about the tea of course.
Nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the Heart of Gold
were spending the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life
they had left to spend.
Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a
seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on.
Obviously the subject of death was in the air, but more as
something to be avoided than harped upon.
Possibly the horror that Zaphod experienced at the prospect of
being reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought
that they might just feel the same way about him and, what's
more, be able to do something about helping to postpone this
reunion.
Or again it might just have been one of the strange promptings
that occasionally surfaced from that dark area of his mind that
he had inexplicably locked off prior to becoming President of the
Galaxy.
"You want to talk to your great grandfather?" boggled Ford.
"Yeah."
"Does it have to be now?"
The ship continued to shake and thunder. The temperature was
rising. The light was getting dimmer - all the energy the
computer didn't require for thinking about tea was being pumped
into the rapidly fading force-field.
"Yeah!" insisted Zaphod. "Listen Ford, I think he may be able to
help us."
"Are you sure you mean think? Pick your words with care."
"Suggest something else we can do."
"Er, well ..."
"OK, round the central console. Now. Come on! Trillian,
Monkeyman, move."
They clustered round the central console in confusion, sat down
and, feeling exceptionally foolish, held hands. With his third
hand Zaphod turned off the lights.
Darkness gripped the ship.
Outside, the thunderous roar of the Definit-Kil cannon continued
to rip at the force-field.
"Concentrate," hissed Zaphod, "on his name."
"What is it?" asked Arthur.
"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth."
"What?"
"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. Concentrate!"
"The Fourth?"
"Yeah. Listen, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod
Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third
..."
"What?"
"There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine.
Now concentrate!"
"Three minutes," said Ford Prefect.
"Why," said Arthur Dent, "are we doing this?"
"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox.
Trillian said nothing. What, she thought, was there to say?
The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a
far corner where Marvin the Paranoid Android sat slumped,
ignoring all and ignored by all, in a private and rather
unpleasant world of his own.
Round the central console four figures hunched in tight
concentration trying to blot from their minds the terrifying
shuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that echoed through
it.
They concentrated.
Still they concentrated.
And still they concentrated.
The seconds ticked by.
On Zaphod's brow stood beads of sweat, first of concentration,
then of frustration and finally of embarrassment.
At last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his hands from
Trillian and Ford and stabbed at the light switch.
"Ah, I was beginning to think you'd never turn the lights on,"
said a voice. "No, not too bright please, my eyes aren't what
they once were."
Four figures jolted upright in their seats. Slowly they turned
their heads to look, though their scalps showed a distinct
propensity to try and stay in the same place.
"Now. Who disturbs me at this time?" said the small, bent, gaunt
figure standing by the sprays of fern at the far end of the
bridge. His two small wispy-haired heads looked so ancient that
it seemed they might hold dim memories of the birth of the
galaxies themselves. One lolled in sleep, but the other squinted
sharply at them. If his eyes weren't what they once were, they
must once have been diamond cutters.
Zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment. He gave the intricate
little double nod which is the traditional Betelgeusian gesture
of familial respect.
"Oh ... er, hi Great Granddad ..." he breathed.
The little old figure moved closer towards them. He peered
through the dim light. He thrust out a bony finger at his great
grandson.
"Ah," he snapped. "Zaphod Beeblebrox. The last of our great line.
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth."
"The First."
"The Nothingth," spat the figure. Zaphod hated his voice. It
always seemed to him to screech like fingernails across the
blackboard of what he liked to think of as his soul.
He shifted awkwardly in his seat.
"Er, yeah," he muttered, "Er, look, I'm really sorry about the
flowers, I meant to send them along, but you know, the shop was
fresh out of wreaths and ..."
"You forget!" snapped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.
"Well ..."
"Too busy. Never think of other people. The living are all the
same."
"Two minutes, Zaphod," whispered Ford in an awed whisper.
Zaphod fidgeted nervously.
"Yeah, but I did mean to send them," he said. "And I'll write to
my great grandmother as well, just as soon as we get out of this
..."
"Your great grandmother," mused the gaunt little figure to
himself.
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "Er, how is she? Tell you what, I'll go and
see her. But first we've just got to ..."
"Your late great grandmother and I are very well," rasped Zaphod
Beeblebrox the Fourth.
"Ah. Oh."
"But very disappointed in you, young Zaphod ..."
"Yeah well ..." Zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of
this conversation, and Ford's heavy breathing at his side told
him that the seconds were ticking away fast. The noise and the
shaking had reached terrifying proportions. He saw Trillian and
Arthur's faces white and unblinking in the gloom.
"Er, Great Grandfather ..."
"We've been following your progress with considerable despondency
..."
"Yeah, look, just at the moment you see ..."
"Not to say contempt!"
"Could you sort of listen for a moment ..."
"I mean what exactly are you doing with your life?"
"I'm being attacked by a Vogon fleet!" cried Zaphod. It was an
exaggeration, but it was his only opportunity so far of getting
the basic point of the exercise across.
"Doesn't surprise me in the least," said the little old figure
with a shrug.
"Only it's happening right now you see," insisted Zaphod
feverishly.
The spectral ancestor nodded, picked up the cup Arthur Dent had
brought in and looked at it with interest.
"Er ... Great Granddad ..."
"Did you know," interrupting the ghostly figure, fixing Zaphod
with a stern look, "that Betelgeuse Five has developed a very
slight eccentricy in its orbit?"
Zaphod didn't and found the information hard to concentrate on
what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on.
"Er, no ... look," he said.
"Me spinning in my grave!" barked the ancestor. He slammed the
cup down and pointed a quivering, stick-like see-through finger
at Zaphod.
"Your fault!" he screeched.
"One minute thirty," muttered Ford, his head in his hands.
"Yeah, look Great Granddad, can you actually help because ..."
"Help?" exclaimed the old man as if he'd been asked for a stoat.
"Yeah, help, and like, now, because otherwise ..."
"Help!" repeated the old man as if he'd been asked for a lightly
grilled stoat in a bun with French fries. He stood amazed.
"You go swanning your way round the Galaxy with your ..." the
ancestor waved a contemptuous hand, "with your disreputable
friends, too busy to put flowers on my grave, plastic ones would
have done, would have been quite appropriate from you, but no.
Too busy. Too modern. Too sceptical - till you suddenly find
yourself in a bit of a fix and come over suddenly all astrally-
minded!"
He shook his head - carefully, so as not to disturb the slumber
of the other one, which was already becoming restive.
"Well, I don't know, young Zaphod," he continued, "I think I'll
have to think about this one."
"One minute ten," said Ford hollowly.
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth peered at him curiously.
"Why does that man keep talking in numbers?" he said.
"Those numbers," said Zaphod tersely, "are the time we've got
left to live."
"Oh," said his great grandfather. He grunted to himself. "Doesn't
apply to me, of course," he said and moved off to a dimmer recess
of the bridge in search of something else to poke around at.
Zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and wondered
if he shouldn't just jump over and have done with it.
"Great Grandfather," he said, "It applies to us! We are still
alive, and we are about to lose our lives."
"Good job too."
"What?"
"What use is your life to anyone? When I think of what you've
made of it the phrase pig's ear' comes irresistibly to my mind."
"But I was President of the Galaxy, man!"
"Huh," muttered his ancestor, "And what kind of a job is that for
a Beeblebrox?"
"Hey, what? Only President you know! Of the whole Galaxy!"
"Conceited little megapuppy."
Zaphod blinked in bewilderment.
"Hey, er, what are you at, man? I mean Great Grandfather."
The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and
tapped him sternly on the knee. This had the effect of reminding
Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didn't feel a
thing.
"You know and I know what being President means, young Zaphod.
You know because you've been it, and I know because I'm dead and
it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective. We have
a saying up here. Life is wasted on the living.'"
"Yeah," said Zaphod bitterly, "very good. Very deep. Right now I
need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads."
"Fifty seconds," grunted Ford Prefect.
"Where was I?" said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.
"Pontificating," said Zaphod Beeblebrox.
"Oh yes."
"Can this guy," muttered Ford quietly to Zaphod, "actually in
fact help us?"
"Nobody else can," whispered Zaphod.
Ford nodded despondently.
"Zaphod!" the ghost was saying, "you became President of the
Galaxy for a reason. Have you forgotten?"
"Could we go into this later?"
"Have you forgotten!" insisted the ghost.
"Yeah! Of course I forgot! I had to forget. They screen your
brain when you get the job you know. If they'd found my head full
of tricksy ideas I'd have been right out on the streets again
with nothing but a fat pension, secretarial staff, a fleet of
ships and a couple of slit throats."
"Ah," nodded the ghost in satisfaction, "then you do remember!"
He paused for a moment.
"Good," he said and the noise stopped.
"Forty-eight seconds," said Ford. He looked again at his watch
and tapped it. He looked up.
"Hey, the noise has stopped," he said.
A mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghost's hard little eyes.
"I've slowed down time for a moment," he said, "just for a moment
you understand. I would hate you to miss all I have to say."
"No, you listen to me, you see-through old bat," said Zaphod
leaping out of his chair, "A - thanks for stopping time and all
that, great, terrific, wonderful, but B - no thanks for the
homily, right? I don't know what this great think I'm meant to be
doing is, and it looks to me as if I was supposed not to know.
And I resent that, right?
"The old me knew. The old me cared. Fine, so far so hoopy. Except
that the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own
brain - my own brain - and locked off the bits that knew and
cared, because if I knew and cared I wouldn't be able to do it. I
wouldn't be able to go and be President, and I wouldn't be able
to steal this ship, which must be the important thing.
"But this former self of mine killed himself off, didn't he, by
changing my brain? OK, that was his choice. This new me has its
own choices to make, and by a strange coincidence those choices
involve not knowing and not caring about this big number,
whatever it is. That's what he wanted, that's what he got.
"Except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in control,
leaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off. Well,
I don't want to know, and I don't want to hear them. That's my
choice. I'm not going to be anybody's puppet, particularly not my
own."
Zaphod banged the console in fury, oblivious to the dumbfolded
looks he was attracting.
"The old me is dead!" he raved, "Killed himself! The dead
shouldn't hang about trying to interfere with the living!"
"And yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape," said the
ghost.
"Ah," said Zaphod, sitting down again, "well that's different
isn't it?"
He grinned at Trillian, weakly.
"Zaphod," rasped the apparition, "I think the only reason I waste
my breath on you is that being dead I don't have any other use
for it."
"OK," said Zaphod, "why don't you tell me what the big secret is.
Try me."
"Zaphod, you knew when you were President of the Galaxy, as did
Yooden Vranx before you, that the President is nothing. A cipher.
Somewhere in the shadows behind is another man, being, something,
with ultimate power. That man, or being, or something, you must
find - the man who controls this Galaxy, and - we suspect -
others. Possibly the entire Universe."
"Why?"
"Why?" exclaimed an astonished ghost, "Why? Look around you lad,
does it look to you as if it's in very good hands?"
"It's alright."
The old ghost glowered at him.
"I will not argue with you. You will simply take this ship, this
Improbability Drive ship to where it is needed. You will do it.
Don't think you can escape your purpose. The Improbability Field
controls you, you are in its grip. What's this?"
He was standing tapping at one of the terminals of Eddie the
Shipboard Computer. Zaphod told him.
"What's it doing?"
"It is trying," said Zaphod with wonderful restraint, "to make
tea."
"Good," said his great grandfather, "I approve of that. Now
Zaphod, "he said, turning and wagging a finger at him, "I don't
know if you are really capable of succeeding in your job. I think
you will not be able to avoid it. However, I am too long dead and
too tired to care as much as I did. The principal reason I am
helping you now is that I couldn't bear the thought of you and
your modern friends slouching about up here. Understood?"
"Yeah, thanks a bundle."
"Oh, and Zaphod?"
"Er, yeah?"
"If you ever find you need help again, you know, if you're in
trouble, need a hand out of a tight corner ..."
"Yeah?"
"Please don't hesitate to get lost."
Within the space of one second, a bolt of light flashed from the
wizened old ghost's hands to the computer, the ghost vanished,
the bridge filled with billowing smoke and the Heart of Gold
leapt an unknown distance through the dimensions of time and
space.
Ten light years away, Gag Halfrunt jacked up his smile by several
notches. As he watched the picture on his vision screen, relayed
across the sub-ether from the bridge of the Vogon ship, he saw
the final shreds of the Heart of Gold's force-shield ripped away,
and the ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke.
Good, he thought.
The end of the last stray survivors of the demolition he had
ordered on the planet Earth, he thought.
The final end of this dangerous (to the psychiatric profession)
and subversive (also to the psychiatric profession) experiment to
find the Question to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe,
and Everything, he thought.
There would be some celebration with his fellows tonight, and in
the morning they would meet again their unhappy, bewildered and
highly profitable patients, secure in the knowledge that the
Meaning of Life would not now be, once and for all, well and
truly sorted out, he thought.
"Family's always embarrassing isn't it?" said Ford to Zaphod as
the smoke began to clear.
He paused, then looked about.
"Where's Zaphod?" he said.
Arthur and Trillian looked about blankly. They were pale and
shaken and didn't know where Zaphod was.
"Marvin?" said Ford, "Where's Zaphod?"
A moment later he said:
"Where's Marvin?"
The robot's corner was empty.
The ship was utterly silent. It lay in thick black space.
Occasionally it rocked and swayed. Every instrument was dead,
every vision screen was dead. They consulted the computer. It
said:
"I regret that I have been temporarily closed to all
communication. Meanwhile, here is some light music."
They turned off the light music.
They searched every corner of the ship in increasing bewilderment
and alarm. Everywhere was dead and silent. Nowhere was there any
trace of Zaphod or of Marvin.
One of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the
Nutri-Matic machine was located.
On the delivery plate of the Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer was a
small tray, on which sat three bone china cups and saucers, a
bone china jug of milk, a silver teapot full of the best tea
Arthur had ever tasted, and a small printed note saying "Wait".
Ursa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in
the known Universe.
Although it is excruciatingly rich, horrifyingly sunny and more
full of wonderfully exciting people than a pomegranate is of
pips, it can hardly be insignificant that when a recent edition
of Playbeing magazine headlined an article with the words "When
you are tired of Ursa Minor Beta you are tired of life", the
suicide rate quadrupled overnight.
Not that there are any nights on Ursa Minor Beta.
It is a West Zone planet which by an inexplicable and somewhat
suspicious freak of topography consists almost entirely of sub-
tropical coastline. By an equally suspicious freak of temporal
relastatics, it is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before
the beach bars close.
No adequate explanation for this has been forthcoming from the
dominant lifeforms on Ursa Minor Beta, who spend most of their
time attempting to achieve spiritual enlightenment by running
round swimming pools, and inviting Investigation Officials form
the Galactic Geo-Temporal Control Board to "have a nice diurnal
anomaly".
There is only one city on Ursa Minor Beta, and that is only
called a city because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on
the ground there than elsewhere.
If you approach Light City by air - and there is no other way of
approaching it, no roads, no port facilities - if you don't fly
they don't want to see you in Light City - you will see why it
has this name. Here the sun shines brightest of all, glittering
on the swimming pools, shimmering on the white, palm-lined
boulevards, glistening on the healthy bronzed specks moving up
and down them, gleaming off the villas, the hazy airpads, the
beach bars and so on.
Most particularly it shines on a building, a tall beautiful
building consisting of two thirty-storey white towers connected
by a bridge half-way up their length.
The building is the home of a book, and was built here on the
proceeds of an extraordinary copyright law suit fought between
the book's editors and a breakfast cereal company.
The book is a guide book, a travel book.
It is one of the most remarkable, certainly the most successful,
books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of
Ursa Minor - more popular than Life Begins at Five Hundred and
Fifty, better selling than The Big Bang Theory - A Personal View
by Eccentrica Gallumbits (the triple breasted whore of Eroticon
Six) and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's latest
blockbusting title Everything You Never Wanted To Know About Sex
But Have Been Forced To Find Out.
(And in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer
Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, it has long surplanted the great
Encyclopaedia Galactica as the standard repository of all
knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and
contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate,
it scores over the older and more pedestrian work in two
important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper, and secondly
it has the words Don't Panic printed in large friendly letters on
its cover.)
It is of course that invaluable companion for all those who want
to see the marvels of the known Universe for less than thirty
Altairan Dollars a day - The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
If you stood with your back to the main entrance lobby of the
Guide offices (assuming you had landed by now and freshened up
with a quick dip and shower) and then walked east, you would pass
along the leafy shade of Life Boulevard, be amazed by the pale
golden colour of the beaches stretching away to your left,
astounded by the mind-surfers floating carelessly along two feet
above the waves as if it was nothing special, surprised and
eventually slightly irritated by the giant palm trees that hum
toneless nothings throughout the daylight hours, in other words
continuously.
If you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard you would enter
the Lalamatine district of shops, bolonut trees and pavement
cafes where the UM-Betans come to relax after a hard afternoon's
relaxation on the beach. The Lalamatine district is one of those
very few areas which doesn't enjoy a perpetual Saturday afternoon
- it enjoys instead the cool of a perpetual early Saturday
evening. Behind it lie the night clubs.
If, on this particular day, afternoon, stretch of eveningtime -
call it what you will - you had approached the second pavement
cafe on the right you would have seen the usual crowd of UM-
Betans chatting, drinking, looking very relaxed, and casually
glancing at each other's watches to see how expensive they were.
You would also have seen a couple of rather dishevelled looking
hitch-hikers from Algol who had recently arrived on an Arcturan
Megafreighter aboard which they had been roughing it for a few
days. They were angry and bewildered to discover that here,
within sight of the Hitch Hiker's Guide building itself, a simple
glass of fruit juice cost the equivalent of over sixty Altairan
dollars.
"Sell out," one of them said, bitterly.
If at that moment you had then looked at the next table but one
you would have seen Zaphod Beeblebrox sitting and looking very
startled and confused.
The reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had
been sitting on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold.
"Absolute sell out," said the voice again.
Zaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two
dishevelled hitch-hikers at the next table. Where the hell was
he? How had he got there? Where was his ship? His hand felt the
arm of the chair on which he was sitting, and then the table in
front of him. They seemed solid enough. He sat very still.
"How can they sit and write a guide for hitch-hikers in a place
like this?" continued the voice. "I mean look at it. Look at it!"
Zaphod was looking at it. Nice place, he thought. But where? And
why?
He fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses. In the
same pocket he felt a hard smooth, unidentified lump of very
heavy metal. He pulled it out and looked at it. He blinked at it
in surprise. Where had he got that? He returned it to his pocket
and put on the sunglasses, annoyed to discover that the metal
object had scratched one of the lenses. Nevertheless, he felt
much more comfortable with them on. They were a double pair of
Joo Janta Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which
had been specially designed to help people develop a relaxed
attitude to danger. At the first hint of trouble they turn
totally black and thus prevent you from seeing anything that
might alarm you.
Apart from the scratch the lenses were clear. He relaxed, but
only a little bit.
The angry hitch-hiker continued to glare at his monstrously
expensive fruit juice.
"Worst thing that ever happened to the Guide, moving to Ursa
Minor Beta," he grumbled, "they've all gone soft. You know, I've
even heard that they've created a whole electronically
synthesized Universe in one of their offices so they can go and
research stories during the day and still go to parties in the
evening. Not that day and evening mean much in this place."
Ursa Minor Beta, thought Zaphod. At least he knew where he was
now. He assumed that this must be his great grandfather's doing,
but why?
Much to his annoyance, a thought popped into his mind. It was
very clear and very distinct, and he had now come to recognize
these thoughts for what they were. His instinct was to resist
them. They were the pre-ordained promptings from the dark and
locked off parts of his mind.
He sat still and ignored the thought furiously. It nagged at him.
He ignored it. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him.
He gave in to it.
What the hell, he thought, go with the flow. He was too tired,
confused and hungry to resist. He didn't even know what the
thought meant.
"Hello? Yes? Megadodo Publications, home of the Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy, the most totally remarkable book in the
whole of the known Universe, can I help you?" said the large
pink-winged insect into one of the seventy phones lined up along
the vast chrome expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the
Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices. It fluttered its wings
and rolled its eyes. It glared at all the grubby people
cluttering up the foyer, soiling the carpets and leaving dirty
handmarks on the upholstery. It adored working for the Hitch
Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it just wished there was some way of
keeping all the hitch-hikers away. Weren't they meant to be
hanging round dirty spaceports or something? It was certain that
it had read something somewhere in the book about the importance
of hanging round dirty spaceports. Unfortunately most of them
seemed to come and hang around in this nice clean shiny foyer
after hanging around in extremely dirty spaceports. And all they
ever did was complain. It shivered its wings.
"What?" it said into the phone. "Yes, I passed on your message to
Mr Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now.
He's on an intergalactic cruise."
It waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who was
angrily trying to engage its attention. The petulant tentacle
directed the angry person to look at the notice on the wall to
its left and not to interrupt an important phone call.
"Yes," said the insect, "he is in his office, but he's on an
intergalactic cruise. Thank you so much for calling." It slammed
down the phone.
"Read the notice," it said to the angry man who was trying to
complain about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of
misinformation contained in the book.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an indispensable
companion to all those who are keen to make sense of life in an
infinitely complex and confusing Universe, for though it cannot
hope to be useful or informative on all matters, it does at least
make the reassuring claim, that where it is inaccurate it is at
least definitely inaccurate. In cases of major discrepancy it's
always reality that's got it wrong.
This was the gist of the notice. It said "The Guide is
definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate."
This has led to some interesting consequences. For instance, when
the Editors of the Guide were sued by the families of those who
had died as a result of taking the entry on the planet Traal
literally (it said "Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very
good meal for visiting tourists" instead of "Ravenous Bugblatter
beasts often make a very good meal of visiting tourists") they
claimed that the first version of the sentence was the more
aesthetically pleasing, summoned a qualified poet to testify
under oath that beauty was truth, truth beauty and hoped thereby
to prove that the guilty party was Life itself for failing to be
either beautiful or true. The judges concurred, and in a moving
speech held that Life itself was in contempt of court, and duly
confiscated it from all those there present before going off to
enjoy a pleasant evening's ultragolf.
Zaphod Beeblebrox entered the foyer. He strode up to the insect
receptionist.
"OK," he said, "Where's Zarniwoop? Get me Zarniwoop."
"Excuse me, sir?" said the insect icily. It did not care to be
addressed in this manner.
"Zarniwoop. Get him, right? Get him now."
"Well, sir," snapped the fragile little creature, "if you could
be a little cool about it ..."
"Look," said Zaphod, "I'm up to here with cool, OK? I'm so
amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat inside me for a
month. I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis. Now
will you move before you blow it?"
"Well, if you'd let me explain, sir," said the insect tapping the
most petulant of all the tentacles at its disposal, "I'm afraid
that isn't possible right now as Mr Zarniwoop is on an
intergalactic cruise."
Hell, thought Zaphod.
"When he's going to be back?" he said.
"Back sir? He's in his office."
Zaphod paused while he tried to sort this particular thought out
in his mind. He didn't succeed.
"This cat's on an intergalactic cruise ... in his office?" He
leaned forward and gripped the tapping tentacle.
"Listen, three eyes," he said, "don't you try to outweird me. I
get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal."
"Well, just who do you think you are, honey?" flounced the insect
quivering its wings in rage, "Zaphod Beeblebrox or something?"
"Count the heads," said Zaphod in a low rasp.
The insect blinked at him. It blinked at him again.
"You are Zaphod Beeblebrox?" it squeaked.
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "but don't shout it out or they'll all want
one."
"The Zaphod Beeblebrox?"
"No, just a Zaphod Beeblebrox, didn't you hear I come in six
packs?"
The insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation.
"But sir," it squealed, "I just heard on the sub-ether radio
report. It said that you were dead ..."
"Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod, "I just haven't stopped moving
yet. Now. Where do I find Zarniwoop?"
"Well, sir, his office is on the fifteenth floor, but ..."
"But he's on an intergalactic cruise, yeah, yeah, how do I get to
him."
"The newly installed Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Vertical
People Transporters are in the far corner sir. But sir ..."
Zaphod was turning to go. He turned back.
"Yeah?" he said.
"Can I ask you why you want to see Mr Zarniwoop?"
"Yeah," said Zaphod, who was unclear on this point himself, "I
told myself I had to."
"Come again sir?"
Zaphod leaned forward, conspirationally.
"I just materialized out of thin air in one of your cafes," he
said, "as a result of an argument with the ghost of my great
grandfather. No sooner had I got there that my former self, the
one that operated on my brain, popped into my head and said Go
see Zarniwoop'. I have never heard of the cat. That is all I
know. That and the fact that I've got to find the man who rules
the Universe."
He winked.
"Mr Beeblebrox, sir," said the insect in awed wonder, "you're so
weird you should be in movies."
"Yeah," said Zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink wing,
"and you, baby, should be in real life."
The insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation and
then reached out a tentacle to answer a ringing phone.
A metal hand restrained it.
"Excuse me," said the owner of the metal hand in a voice that
would have made an insect of a more sentimental disposition
collapse in tears.
This was not such an insect, and it couldn't stand robots.
"Yes, sir," it snapped, "can I help you?"
"I doubt it," said Marvin.
"Well in that case, if you'll just excuse me ..." Six of the
phones were now ringing. A million things awaited the insect's
attention.
"No one can help me," intoned Marvin.
"Yes, sir, well ..."
"Not that anyone tried of course." The restraining metal hand
fell limply by Marvin's side. His head hung forward very
slightly.
"Is that so," said the insect tartly.
"Hardly worth anyone's while to help a menial robot is it?"
"I'm sorry, sir, if ..."
"I mean where's the percentage in being kind or helpful to a
robot if it doesn't have any gratitude circuits?"
"And you don't have any?" said the insect, who didn't seem to be
able to drag itself out of this conversation.
"I've never had occasion to find out," Marvin informed it.
"Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal ..."
"Aren't you going to ask me what I want?"
The insect paused. Its long thin tongue darted out and licked its
eyes and darted back again.
"Is it worth it?" it asked.
"Is anything?" said Marvin immediately.
"What ... do ... you ... want?"
"I'm looking for someone."
"Who?" hissed the insect.
"Zaphod Beeblebrox," said Marvin, "he's over there."
The insect shook with rage. It could hardly speak.
"Then why did you ask me?" it screamed.
"I just wanted something to talk to," said Marvin.
"What!"
"Pathetic isn't it?"
With a grinding of gears Marvin turned and trundled off. He
caught up with Zaphod approaching the elevators. Zaphod span
round in astonishment.
"Hey ... Marvin!" he said, "Marvin! How did you get here?"
Marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him.
"I don't know," he said.
"But ..."
"One moment I was sitting in your ship feeling very depressed,
and the next moment I was standing here feeling utterly
miserable. An Improbability Field I expect."
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "I expect my great grandfather sent you
along to keep me company."
"Thanks a bundle grandad," he added to himself under his breath.
"So, how are you?" he said aloud.
"Oh, fine," said Marvin, "if you happen to like being me which
personally I don't."
"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod as the elevator doors opened.
"Hello," said the elevator sweetly, "I am to be your elevator for
this trip to the floor of your choice. I have been designed by
the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation to take you, the visitor to
the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, into these their offices.
If you enjoy your ride, which will be swift and pleasurable, then
you may care to experience some of the other elevators which have
recently been installed in the offices of the Galactic tax
department, Boobiloo Baby Foods and the Sirian State Mental
Hospital, where many ex-Sirius Cybernetics Corporation executives
will be delighted to welcome your visits, sympathy, and happy
tales of the outside world."
"Yeah," said Zaphod, stepping into it, "what else do you do
besides talk?"
"I go up," said the elevator, "or down."
"Good," said Zaphod, "We're going up."
"Or down," the elevator reminded him.
"Yeah, OK, up please."
There was a moment of silence.
"Down's very nice," suggested the elevator hopefully.
"Oh yeah?"
"Super."
"Good," said Zaphod, "Now will you take us up?"
"May I ask you," inquired the elevator in its sweetest, most
reasonable voice, "if you've considered all the possibilities
that down might offer you?"
Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall. He
didn't need this, he thought to himself, this of all things he
had no need of. He hadn't asked to be here. If he was asked at
this moment where he would like to be he would probably have said
he would like to be lying on the beach with at least fifty
beautiful women and a small team of experts working out new ways
they could be nice to him, which was his usual reply. To this he
would probably have added something passionate on the subject of
food.
One thing he didn't want to be doing was chasing after the man
who ruled the Universe, who was only doing a job which he might
as well keep at, because if it wasn't him it would only be
someone else. Most of all he didn't want to be standing in an
office block arguing with an elevator.
"Like what other possibilities?" he asked wearily.
"Well," the voice trickled on like honey on biscuits, "there's
the basement, the microfiles, the heating system ... er ..."
It paused.
"Nothing particularly exciting," it admitted, "but they are
alternatives."
"Holy Zarquon," muttered Zaphod, "did I ask for an existentialist
elevator?" he beat his fists against the wall.
"What's the matter with the thing?" he spat.
"It doesn't want to go up," said Marvin simply, "I think it's
afraid."
"Afraid?" cried Zaphod, "Of what? Heights? An elevator that's
afraid of heights?"
"No," said the elevator miserably, "of the future ..."
"The future?" exclaimed Zaphod, "What does the wretched thing
want, a pension scheme?"
At that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall behind
them. From the walls around them came the sound of suddenly
active machinery.
"We can all see into the future," whispered the elevator in what
sounded like terror, "it's part of our programming."
Zaphod looked out of the elevator - an agitated crowd had
gathered round the elevator area, pointing and shouting.
Every elevator in the building was coming down, very fast.
He ducked back in.
"Marvin," he said, "just get this elevator go up will you? We've
got to get to Zarniwoop."
"Why?" asked Marvin dolefully.
"I don't know," said Zaphod, "but when I find him, he'd better
have a very good reason for me wanting to see him."
Modern elevators are strange and complex entities. The ancient
electric winch and "maximum-capacity-eight-persons" jobs bear as
much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical
People Transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire
west wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital.
This is because they operate on the curios principle of
"defocused temporal perception". In other words they have the
capacity to see dimly into the immediate future, which enables
the elevator to be on the right floor to pick you up even before
you knew you wanted it, thus eliminating all the tedious
chatting, relaxing, and making friends that people were
previously forced to do whist waiting for elevators.
Not unnaturally, many elevators imbued with intelligence and
precognition became terribly frustrated with the mindless
business of going up and down, up and down, experimented briefly
with the notion of going sideways, as a sort of existential
protest, demanded participation in the decision-making process
and finally took to squatting in basements sulking.
An impoverished hitch-hiker visiting any planets in the Sirius
star system these days can pick up easy money working as a
counsellor for neurotic elevators.
At the fifteenth floor the elevator doors opened quickly.
"Fifteenth," said the elevator, "and remember, I'm only doing
this because I like your robot."
Zaphod and Marvin bundled out of the elevator which instantly
snapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would
take it.
Zaphod looked around warily. The corridor was deserted and silent
and gave no clue as to where Zarniwoop might be found. All the
doors that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked.
They were standing close to the bridge which led across from one
tower of the building to the other. Through a large window the
brilliant sun of Ursa Minor Beta threw blocks of light in which
danced small specks of dust. A shadow flitted past momentarily.
"Left in the lurch by a lift," muttered Zaphod, who was feeling
at his least jaunty.
They both stood and looked in both directions.
"You know something?" said Zaphod to Marvin.
"More that you can possibly imagine."
"I'm dead certain this building shouldn't be shaking," Zaphod
said.
It was just a light tremor through the soles of his feet - and
another one. In the sunbeams the flecks of dust danced more
vigorously. Another shadow flitted past.
Zaphod looked at the floor.
"Either," he said, not very confidently, "they've got some vibro
system for toning up your muscles while you work, or ..."
He walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because at
that moment his Joo Janta Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive
sunglasses had turned utterly black. A large shadow flitted past
the window with a sharp buzz.
Zaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so the building
shook with a thunderous roar. He leapt to the window.
"Or," he said, "this building's being bombed!"
Another roar cracked through the building.
"Who in the Galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company?"
asked Zaphod, but never heard Marvin's reply because at that
moment the building shook with another bomb attack. He tried to
stagger back to the elevator - a pointless manoeuvre he realized,
but the only one he could think of.
Suddenly, at the end of the corridor leading at right angles from
this one, he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view, a
man. The man saw him.
"Beeblebrox, over here!" he shouted.
Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the
building.
"No," called Zaphod, "Beeblebrox over here! Who are you?"
"A friend!" shouted back the man. He ran towards Zaphod.
"Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, "Anyone's friend in particular, or just
generally well disposed of people?"
The man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking beneath his
feet like an excited blanket. He was short, stocky and
weatherbeaten and his clothes looked as if they'd been twice
round the Galaxy and back with him in them.
"Do you know," Zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived, "your
building's being bombed?"
The man indicated his awareness.
It suddenly stopped being light. Glancing round at the window to
see why, Zaphod gaped as a huge sluglike, gunmetal-green
spacecraft crept through the air past the building. Two more
followed it.
"The government you deserted is out to get you, Zaphod," hissed
the man, "they've sent a squadron of Frogstar Fighters."
"Frogstar Fighters!" muttered Zaphod, "Zarquon!"
"You get the picture?"
"What are Frogstar Fighters?" Zaphod was sure he'd heard someone
talk about them when he was President, but he never paid much
attention to official matters.
The man was pulling him back through a door. He went with him.
With a searing whine a small black spider-like object shot
through the air and disappeared down the corridor.
"What was that?" hissed Zaphod.
"Frogstar Scout robot class A out looking for you," said the man.
"Hey yeah?"
"Get down!"
From the opposite direction came a larger black spider-like
object. It zapped past them.
"And that was ...?"
"A Frogstar Scout robot class B out looking for you."
"And that?" said Zaphod, as a third one seared through the air.
"A Frogstar Scout robot class C out looking for you."
"Hey," chuckled Zaphod to himself, "pretty stupid robots eh?"
From over the bridge came a massive rumbling hum. A gigantic
black shape was moving over it from the opposite tower, the size
and shape of a tank.
"Holy photon, what's that?"
"A tank," said the man, "Frogstar Scout robot class D come to get
you."
"Should we leave?"
"I think we should."
"Marvin!" called Zaphod.
"What do you want?"
Marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the corridor and
looked at them.
"You see that robot coming towards us?"
Marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward towards
them over the bridge. He looked down at his own small metal body.
He looked back up at the tank.
"I suppose you want me to stop it," he said.
"Yeah."
"Whilst you save your skins."
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "get in there!"
"Just so long," said Marvin, "as I know where I stand."
The man tugged at Zaphod's arm, and Zaphod followed him off down
the corridor.
A point occurred to him about this.
"Where are we going?" he said.
"Zarniwoop's office."
"Is this any time to keep an appointment?"
"Come on."
Marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor. He was not in
fact a particularly small robot. His silver body gleamed in the
dusty sunbeams and shook with the continual barrage which the
building was still undergoing.
He did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black tank
rolled to a halt in front of him. The tank examined him with a
probe. The probe withdrew.
Marvin stood there.
"Out of my way little robot," growled the tank.
"I'm afraid," said Marvin, "that I've been left here to stop
you."
The probe extended again for a quick recheck. It withdrew again.
"You? Stop me?" roared the tank. "Go on!"
"No, really I have," said Marvin simply.
"What are you armed with?" roared the tank in disbelief.
"Guess," said Marvin.
The tank's engines rumbled, its gears ground. Molecule-sized
electronic relays deep in its micro-brain flipped backwards and
forwards in consternation.
"Guess?" said the tank.
Zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a
second and along a third. The building continued to rock and
judder and this puzzled Zaphod. If they wanted to blow the
building up, why was it taking so long?
With difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous
unmarked doors and heaved at it. With a sudden jolt it opened and
they fell inside.
All this way, thought Zaphod, all this trouble, all this not-
lying-on-the-beach-having-a-wonderful-time, and for what? A
single chair, a single desk and a single dirty ashtray in an
undecorated office. The desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust
and single, revolutionary form of paper clip, was empty.
"Where," said Zaphod, "is Zarniwoop?" feeling that his already
tenuous grasp of the point of this whole exercise was beginning
to slip.
"He's on an intergalactic cruise," said the man.
Zaphod tried to size the man up. Earnest type, he thought, not a
barrel of laughs. He probably apportioned a fair whack of his
time to running up and down heaving corridors, breaking down
doors and making cryptic remarks in empty offices.
"Let me introduce myself," the man said, "My name is Roosta, and
this is my towel."
"Hello Roosta," said Zaphod.
"Hello, towel," he added as Roosta held out to him a rather nasty
old flowery towel. Not knowing what to do with it, he shook it by
the corner.
Outside the window, one of the huge slug-like, gunmetal-green
spaceships growled past.
"Yes, go on," said Marvin to the huge battle machine, "you'll
never guess."
"Errmmm ..." said the machine, vibrating with unaccustomed
thought, "laser beams?"
Marvin shook his head solemnly.
"No," muttered the machine in its deep guttural rumble, "Too
obvious. Anti-matter ray?" it hazarded.
"Far too obvious," admonished Marvin.
"Yes," grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed, "Er ... how about
an electron ram?"
This was new to Marvin.
"What's that?" he said.
"One of these," said the machine with enthusiasm.
From its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single lethal
blaze of light. Behind Marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a
heap of dust. The dust billowed briefly, then settled.
"No," said Marvin, "not one of those."
"Good though, isn't it?"
"Very good," agreed Marvin.
"I know," said the Frogstar battle machine, after another
moment's consideration, "you must have one of those new Xanthic
Re-Structron Destabilized Zenon Emitters!"
"Nice, aren't they?" said Marvin.
"That's what you've got?" said the machine in considerable awe.
"No," said Marvin.
"Oh," said the machine, disappointed, "then it must be ..."
"You're thinking along the wrong lines," said Marvin, "You're
failing to take into account something fairly basic in the
relationship between men and robots."
"Er, I know," said the battle machine, "is it ..." it tailed off
into thought again.
"Just think," urged Marvin, "they left me, an ordinary, menial
robot, to stop you, a gigantic heavy-duty battle machine, whilst
they ran off to save themselves. What do you think they would
leave me with?"
"Oooh, er," muttered the machine in alarm, "something pretty damn
devastating I should expect."
"Expect!" said Marvin, "oh yes, expect. I'll tell you what they
gave me to protect myself with shall I@"
"Yes, alright," said the battle machine, bracing itself.
"Nothing," said Marvin.
There was a dangerous pause.
"Nothing?" roared the battle machine.
"Nothing at all," intoned Marvin dismally, "not an electronic
sausage."
The machine heaved about with fury.
"Well, doesn't that just take the biscuit!" it roared, "Nothing,
eh? Just don't think, do they?"
"And me," said Marvin in a soft low voice, "with this terrible
pain in all the diodes down my left side."
"Makes you spit, doesn't it?"
"Yes," agreed Marvin with feeling.
"Hell that makes me angry," bellowed the machine, "think I'll
smash that wall down!"
The electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of light and
took out the wall next to the machine.
"How do you think I feel?" said Marvin bitterly.
"Just ran off and left you, did they?" the machine thundered.
"Yes," said Marvin.
"I think I'll shoot down their bloody ceiling as well!" raged the
tank.
It took out the ceiling of the bridge.
"That's very impressive," murmured Marvin.
"You ain't seeing nothing yet," promised the machine, "I can take
out this floor too, no trouble!"
It took out the floor, too.
"Hell's bells!" the machine roared as it plummeted fifteen
storeys and smashed itself to bits on the ground below.
"What a depressingly stupid machine," said Marvin and trudged
away.
"So, do we just sit here, or what?" said Zaphod angrily, "what do
these guys out here want?"
"You, Beeblebrox," said Roosta, "they're going to take you to the
Frogstar - the most totally evil world in the Galaxy."
"Oh, yeah?" said Zaphod. "They'll have to come and get me first."
"They have come and got you," said Roosta, "look out of the
window."
Zaphod looked, and gaped.
"The ground's going away!" he gasped, "where are they taking the
ground?"
"They're taking the building," said Roosta, "we're airborne."
Clouds streaked past the office window.
Out in the open air again Zaphod could see the ring of dark green
Frogstar Fighters round the uprooted tower of the building. A
network of force beams radiated in from them and held the tower
in a firm grip.
Zaphod shook his head in perplexity.
"What have I done to deserve this?" he said, "I walk into a
building, they take it away."
"It's not what you've done they're worried about," said Roosta,
"it's what you're going to do."
"Well don't I get a say in that?"
"You did, years ago. You'd better hold on, we're in for a fast
and bumpy journey."
"If I ever meet myself," said Zaphod, "I'll hit myself so hard I
won't know what's hit me."
Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod accusingly,
slumped in a corner and switched himself off.
On the bridge of the Heart of Gold, all was silent. Arthur stared
at the rack in front of him and thought. He caught Trillian's
eyes as she looked at him inquiringly. He looked back at the
rack.
Finally he saw it.
He picked up five small plastic squares and laid them on the
board that lay just in front of the rack.
The five squares had on them the five letters E, X, Q, U and I.
He laid them next to the letters S, I, T, E.
"Exquisite," he said, "on a triple word score. Scores rather a
lot I'm afraid."
The ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for the 'n'th
time.
Trillian sighed and started to sort them out again.
Up and down the silent corridors echoed Ford Prefect's feet as he
stalked the ship thumping dead instruments.
Why did the ship keep shaking? he thought.
Why did it rock and sway?
Why could he not find out where they were?
Where, basically, were they?
The left-hand tower of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy
offices streaked through interstellar space at a speed never
equalled either before or since by any other office block in the
Universe.
In a room halfway up it, Zaphod Beeblebrox strode angrily.
Roosta sat on the edge of the desk doing some routine towel
maintenance.
"Hey, where did you say this building was flying to?" demanded
Zaphod.
"The Frogstar," said Roosta, "the most totally evil place in the
Universe."
"Do they have food there?" said Zaphod.
"Food? You're going to the Frogstar and you're worried about
whether they got food?"
"Without food I may not make it to the Frogstar."
Out of the window, they could see nothing but the flickering
light of the force beams, and vague green streaks which were
presumably the distorted shapes of the Frogstar Fighters. At this
speed, space itself was invisible, and indeed unreal.
"Here, suck this," said Roosta, offering Zaphod his towel.
Zaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to leap out of
his forehead on a small spring.
"It's soaked in nutrients," explained Roosta.
"What are you, a messy eater or something?" said Zaphod.
"The yellow stripes are high in protein, the green ones have
vitamin B and C complexes, the little pink flowers contain
wheatgerm extracts."
Zaphod took and looked at it in amazement.
"What are the brown stains?" he asked.
"Bar-B-Q sauce," said Roosta, "for when I get sick of wheatgerm."
Zaphod sniffed it doubtfully.
Even more doubtfully, he sucked a corner. He spat it out again.
"Ugh," he stated.
"Yes," said Roosta, "when I've had to suck that end I usually
need to suck the other end a bit too."
"Why," asked Zaphod suspiciously, "what's in that?"
"Anti-depressants," said Roosta.
"I've gone right off this towel, you know," said Zaphod handing
it back.
Roosta took it back from him, swung himself off the desk, walked
round it, sat in the chair and put his feet up.
"Beeblebrox," he said, sticking his hands behind his head, "have
you any idea what's going to happen to you on the Frogstar?"
"They're going to feed me?" hazarded Zaphod hopefully.
"They're going to feed you," said Roosta, "into the Total
Perspective Vortex!"
Zaphod had never heard of this. He believed that he had heard of
all the fun things in the Galaxy, so he assumed that the Total
Perspective Vortex was not fun. He asked what it was.
"Only," said Roosta, "the most savage psychic torture a sentinent
being can undergo."
Zaphod nodded a resigned nod.
"So," he said, "no food, huh?"
"Listen!" said Roosta urgently, "you can kill a man, destroy his
body, break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can
annihilate a man's soul! The treatment lasts seconds, but the
effect lasts the rest of your life!"
"You ever had a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster?" asked Zaphod
sharply.
"This is worse."
"Phreeow!" admitted Zaphod, much impressed.
"Any idea why these guys might want to do this to me?" he added a
moment later.
"They believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever.
They know what you're after."
"Could they drop me a note and let me know as well?"
"You know," said Roosta, "you know, Beeblebrox. You want to meet
the man who rules the Universe."
"Can he cook?" said Zaphod. On reflection he added:
"I doubt if he can. If he could cook a good meal he wouldn't
worry about the rest of the Universe. I want to meet a cook."
Roosta sighed heavily.
"What are you doing here anyway?" demanded Zaphod, "what's all
this got to so with you?"
"I'm just one of those who planned this thing, along with
Zarniwoop, along with Yooden Vranx, along with your great
grandfather, along with you, Beeblebrox."
"Me?"
"Yes, you. I was told you had changed, I didn't realize how
much."
"But ..."
"I am here to do one job. I will do it before I leave you."
"What job, man, what are you talking about?"
"I will do it before I leave you."
Roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence.
Zaphod was terribly glad.
The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale
and unwholesome.
The dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over
salt flats, dried up marshland, tangled and rotting vegetation
and the crumbling remains of ruined cities. No life moved across
its surface. The ground, like that of many planets in this part
of the Galaxy, had long been deserted.
The howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the
old decaying houses of the cities; it was more desolate as it
whipped about the bottoms of the tall black towers that swayed
uneasily here and there about the surface of this world. At the
top of these towers lived colonies of large, scraggy, evil
smelling birds, the sole survivors of the civilization that once
lived here.
The howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however, when it
passed over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey
plain on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities.
This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world
the reputation of being the most totally evil place in the
Galaxy. From without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet
across. From within it was something more monstrous than the mind
can comprehend.
About a hundred yards or so away, and separated from it by a
pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable
was what would probably have to be described as a landing pad of
sorts. That is to say that scattered over a largish area were the
ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash-landed buildings.
Flitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind that
was waiting for something.
The mind directed its attention into the air, and before very
long a distant speck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller
specks.
The larger speck was the left-hand tower of the Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy office building, descending through the
stratosphere of Frogstar World B.
As it descended, Roosta suddenly broke the long uncomfortable
silence that had grown up between the two men.
He stood up and gathered his towel into a bag. He said:
"Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do."
Zaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner
sharing unspoken thoughts with Marvin.
"Yeah?" he said.
"The building will shortly be landing. When you leave the
building, do not go out of the door," said Roosta, "go out of the
window."
"Good luck," he added, and walked out of the door, disappearing
from Zaphod's life as mysteriously as he had entered it.
Zaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Roosta had already looked
it. He shrugged and returned to the corner.
Two minutes later, the building crashlanded amongst the other
wreckage. Its escort of Frogstar Fighters deactivated their force
beams and soared off into the air again, bound for Frogstar World
A, an altogether more congenial spot. They never landed on
Frogstar World B. No one did. No one ever walked on its surface
other than the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex.
Zaphod was badly shaken by the crash. He lay for a while in the
silent dusty rubble to which most of the room had been reduced.
He felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in his
life. He felt bewildered, he felt lonely, he felt unloved.
Eventually he felt he ought to get whatever it was over with.
He looked around the cracked and broken room. The wall had split
round the door frame, and the door hung open. The window, by some
miracle was closed and unbroken. For a while he hesitated, then
he thought that if his strange and recent companion had been
through all that he had been through just to tell him what he had
told him, then there must be a good reason for it. With Marvin's
help he got the window open. Outside it, the cloud of dust
aroused by the crash, and the hulks of the other buildings with
which this one was surrounded, effectively prevented Zaphod from
seeing anything of the world outside.
Not that this concerned him unduly. His main concern was what he
saw when he looked down. Zarniwoop's office was on the fifteenth
floor. The building had landed at a tilt of about forty-five
degrees, but still the descent looked heart-stopping.
Eventually, stung by the continuous series of contemptuous looks
that Marvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and
clambered out on to the steeply inclined side of the building.
Marvin followed him, and together they began to crawl slowly and
painfully down the fifteen floors that separated them from the
ground.
As he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs, his eyes
smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin.
The occasional remark from Marvin of the order of "This is the
sort of thing you lifeforms enjoy is it? I ask merely for
information," did little to improve his state of mind.
About half-way down the side of the shattered building they
stopped to rest. It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with
fear and exhaustion that Marvin seemed a mite more cheerful than
usual. Eventually he realized this wasn't so. The robot just
seemed cheerful in comparison with his own mood.
A large, scraggy black bird came flapping through the slowly
settling clouds of dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs,
landed on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from Zaphod.
It folded its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch.
Its wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head
and neck seemed curiously large for a bird. Its face was flat,
the beak underdeveloped, and half-way along the underside of its
wings the vestiges of something handlike could be clearly seen.
In fact, it looked almost human.
It turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and clicked its beak in a
desultory fashion.
"Go away," said Zaphod.
"OK," muttered the bird morosely and flapped off into the dust
again.
Zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment.
"Did that bird just talk to me?" he asked Marvin nervously. He
was quite prepared to believe the alternative explanation, that
he was in fact hallucinating.
"Yes," confirmed Marvin.
"Poor souls," said a deep, ethereal voice in Zaphod's ear.
Twisting round violently to find the source of the voice nearly
caused Zaphod to fall off the building. He grabbed savagely at a
protruding window fitting and cut his hand on it. He hung on,
breathing heavily.
The voice had no visible source whatever - there was no one
there. Nevertheless, it spoke again.
"A tragic history behind them, you know. A terrible blight."
Zaphod looked wildly about. The voice was deep and quiet. In
other circumstances it would even be described as soothing. There
is, however, nothing soothing about being addressed by a
disembodied voice out of nowhere, particularly if you are, like
Zaphod Beeblebrox, not at your best and hanging from a ledge
eight storeys up a crashed building.
"Hey, er ..." he stammered.
"Shall I tell you their story?" inquired the voice quietly.
"Hey, who are you?" panted Zaphod. "Where are you?"
"Later then, perhaps," murmured the voice. "I am Gargravarr. I am
the Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex."
"Why can't I see ..."
"You will find your progress down the building greatly
facilitated," the voice lifted, "if you move about two yards to
your left. Why don't you try it?"
Zaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves
leading all the way down the side of the building. Gratefully he
shifted himself across to them.
"Why don't I see you again at the bottom?" said the voice in his
ear, and as it spoke it faded.
"Hey," called out Zaphod, "Where are you ..."
"It'll only take a couple of minutes ..." said the voice very
faintly.
"Marvin," said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly
next to him, "Did a ... did a voice just ..."
"Yes," Marvin replied tersely.
Zaphod nodded. He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses again.
They were completely black, and by now quite badly scratched by
the unexpected metal object in his pocket. He put them on. He
would find his way down the building more comfortably if he
didn't actually have to look at what he was doing.
Minutes later he clambered over the ripped and mangled
foundations of the building and, once more removing his
sunglasses, he dropped to the ground.
Marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down in the
dust and rubble, from which position he seemed too disinclined to
move.
"Ah, there you are," said the voice suddenly in Zaphod's ear,
"excuse me leaving you like that, it's just that I have a
terrible head for heights. At least," it added wistfully, "I did
have a terrible head for heights."
Zaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he had
missed something which might be the source of the voice. All he
saw, however, was the dust, the rubble and the towering hulks of
the encircling buildings.
"Hey, er, why can't I see you?" he said, "why aren't you here?"
"I am here," said the voice slowly, "my body wanted to come but
it's a bit busy at the moment. Things to do, people to see."
After what seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh it added, "You
know how it is with bodies."
Zaphod wasn't sure about this.
"I thought I did," he said.
"I only hope it's gone for a rest cure," continued the voice,
"the way it's been living recently it must be on its last
elbows."
"Elbows?" said Zaphod, "don't you mean last legs?"
The voice said nothing for a while. Zaphod looked around
uneasily. He didn't know if it was gone or was still there or
what it was doing. Then the voice spoke again.
"So, you are to be put into the Vortex, yes?"
"Er, well," said Zaphod with a very poor attempt at nonchalance,
"this cat's in no hurry, you know. I can just slouch about and
take in a look at the local scenery, you know?"
"Have you seen the local scenery?" asked the voice of Gargravarr.
"Er, no."
Zaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner of one
of the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view.
He looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B.
"Ah, OK," he said, "I'll just sort of slouch about then."
"No," said Gargravarr, "the Vortex is ready for you now. You must
come. Follow me."
"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, "and how am I meant to do that?"
"I'll hum for you," said Gargravarr, "follow the humming."
A soft keening sound drifted through the air, a pale, sad sound
that seemed to be without any kind of focus. It was only by
listening very carefully that Zaphod was able to detect the
direction from which it was coming. Slowly, dazedly, he stumbled
off in its wake. What else was there to do?
The Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big
place, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend
to ignore.
Many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their own
devising, and this is what most beings in fact do.
For instance, in one corner of the Eastern Galactic Arm lies the
large forest planet Oglaroon, the entire "intelligent" population
of which lives permanently in one fairly small and crowded nut
tree. In which tree they are born, live, fall in love, carve tiny
speculative articles in the bark on the meaning of life, the
futility of death and the importance of birth control, fight a
few extremely minor wars, and eventually die strapped to the
underside of some of the less accessible outer branches.
In fact the only Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those
who are hurled out of it for the heinous crime of wondering
whether any of the other trees might be capable of supporting
life at all, or indeed whether the other trees are anything other
than illusions brought on by eating too many Oglanuts.
Exotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life form in
the Galaxy which is not in some way guilty of the same thing,
which is why the Total Perspective Vortex is as horrific as it
is.
For when you are put into the Vortex you are given just one
momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of
creation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic
dot on a microscopic dot, which says "You are here."
The grey plain stretched before Zaphod, a ruined, shattered
plain. The wind whipped wildly over it.
Visible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome. This,
gathered Zaphod, was where he was going. This was the Total
Perspective Vortex.
As he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a sudden inhuman wail of
terror emanated from it as of a man having his soul burnt from
his body. It screamed above the wind and died away.
Zaphod started with fear and his blood seemed to turn to liquid
helium.
"Hey, what was that?" he muttered voicelessly.
"A recording," said Gargravarr, "of the last man who was put in
the Vortex. It is always played to the next victim. A sort of
prelude."
"Hey, it really sounds bad ..." stammered Zaphod, "couldn't we
maybe slope off to a party or something for a while, think it
over?"
"For all I know," said Gargravarr's ethereal voice, "I'm probably
at one. My body that is. It goes to a lot of parties without me.
Says I only get in the way. Hey ho."
"What is all this with your body?" said Zaphod, anxious to delay
whatever it was that was going to happen to him.
"Well, it's ... it's busy you know," said Gargravarr hesitantly.
"You mean it's got a mind of its own?" said Zaphod.
There was a long and slightly chilly pause before Gargravarr
spoke again.
"I have to say," he replied eventually, "that I find that remark
in rather poor taste."
Zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology.
"No matter," said Gargravarr, "you weren't to know."
The voice fluttered unhappily.
"The truth is," it continued in tones which suggested he was
trying very hard to keep it under control, "the truth is that we
are currently undergoing a period of legal trial separation. I
suspect it will end in divorce."
The voice was still again, leaving Zaphod with no idea of what to
say. He mumbled uncertainly.
"I think we are probably not very well suited," said Gargravarr
again at length, "we never seemed to be happy doing the same
things. We always had the greatest arguments over sex and
fishing. Eventually we tried to combine the two, but that only
led to disaster, as you can probably imagine. And now my body
refuses to let me in. It won't even see me ..."
He paused again, tragically. The wind whipped across the plain.
"It says I only inhibit it. I pointed out that in fact I was
meant to inhibit it, and it said that that was exactly the sort
of smart alec remark that got right up a body's left nostril, and
so we left it. It will probably get custody of my forename."
"Oh ..." said Zaphod faintly, "and what's that?"
"Pizpot," said the voice, "My name is Pizpot Gargravarr. Says it
all really doesn't it?"
"Errr ..." said Zaphod sympathetically.
"And that is why I, as a disembodied mind, have this job,
Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex. No one will ever walk
on the ground of this planet. Except the victims of the Vortex -
they don't really count I'm afraid."
"Ah ..."
"I'll tell you the story. Would you like to hear it?"
"Er ..."
"Many years ago this was a thriving, happy planet - people,
cities shops, a normal world. Except that on the high streets of
these cities there were slightly more shoe shops than one might
have thought necessary. And slowly, insidiously, the numbers of
these shoe shops were increasing. It's a well known economic
phenomenon but tragic to see it in operation, for the more shoe
shops there were, the more shoes they had to make and the worse
and more unwearable they became. And the worse they were to wear,
the more people had to buy to keep themselves shod, and the more
the shops proliferated, until the whole economy of the place
passed what I believe is termed the Shoe Event Horizon, and it
became no longer economically possible to build anything other
than shoe shops. Result - collapse, ruin and famine. Most of the
population died out. Those few who had the right kind of genetic
instability mutated into birds - you've seen one of them - who
cursed their feet, cursed the ground, and vowed that none should
walk on it again. Unhappy lot. Come, I must take you to the
Vortex."
Zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward across
the plain.
"And you," he said, "you come from this hellhole pit do you?"
"No no," said Gargravarr, taken aback, "I come from the Frogstar
World C. Beautiful place. Wonderful fishing. I flit back there in
the evenings. Though all I can do now is watch. The Total
Perspective Vortex is the only thing on this planet with any
function. It was built here because no one else wanted it on
their doorstep."
At that moment another dismal scream rent the air and Zaphod
shuddered.
"What can do that to a guy?" he breathed.
"The Universe," said Gargravarr simply, "the whole infinite
Universe. The infinite suns, the infinite distances between them,
and yourself an invisible dot on an invisible dot, infinitely
small."
"Hey, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, man, you know," muttered Zaphod
trying to flap the last remnants of his ego.
Gargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful humming
till they reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the
plain.
As they reached it, a door hummed open in the side, revealing a
small darkened chamber within.
"Enter," said Gargravarr.
Zaphod started with fear.
"Hey, what, now?" he said.
"Now."
Zaphod peered nervously inside. The chamber was very small. It
was steel-lined and there was hardly space in it for more than
one man.
"It ... er ... it doesn't look like any kind of Vortex to me,"
said Zaphod.
"It isn't," said Gargravarr, "it's just the elevator. Enter."
With infinite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it. He was aware of
Gargravarr being in the elevator with him, though the disembodied
man was not for the moment speaking.
The elevator began its descent.
"I must get myself into the right frame of mind for this,"
muttered Zaphod.
"There is no right frame of mind," said Gargravarr sternly.
"You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate."
"I don't. The Vortex does."
At the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the elevator opened up
and Zaphod stumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel-lined
chamber.
At the far side of it stood a single upright steel box, just
large enough for a man to stand in.
It was that simple.
It connected to a small pile of components and instruments via a
single thick wire.
"Is that it?" said Zaphod in surprise.
"That is it."
Didn't look too bad, thought Zaphod.
"And I get in there do I?" said Zaphod.
"You get in there," said Gargravarr, "and I'm afraid you must do
it now."
"OK, OK," said Zaphod.
He opened the door of the box and stepped in.
Inside the box he waited.
After five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was
there in the box with him.
The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole
Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses.
To explain - since every piece of matter in the Universe is in
some way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe,
it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation -
every sun, every planet, their orbits, their composition and
their economic and social history from, say, one small piece of
fairy cake.
The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so
basically in order to annoy his wife.
Trin Tragula - for that was his name - was a dreamer, a thinker,
a speculative philosopher or, as his wife would have it, an
idiot.
And she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate
amount of time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over
the mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of
pieces of fairy cake.
"Have some sense of proportion!" she would say, sometimes as
often as thirty-eight times in a single day.
And so he built the Total Perspective Vortex - just to show her.
And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated
from a piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his
wife: so that when he turned it on she saw in one instant the
whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it.
To Trin Tragula's horror, the shock completely annihilated her
brain; but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved
conclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of this
size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of
proportion.
The door of the Vortex swung open.
From his disembodied mind Gargravarr watched dejectedly. He had
rather liked Zaphod Beeblebrox in a strange sort of way. He was
clearly a man of many qualities, even if they were mostly bad
ones.
He waited for him to flop forwards out of the box, as they all
did.
Instead, he stepped out.
"Hi!" he said.
"Beeblebrox ..." gasped Gargravarr's mind in amazement.
"Could I have a drink please?" said Zaphod.
"You ... you ... have been in the Vortex?" stammered Gargravarr.
"You saw me, kid."
"And it was working?"
"Sure was."
"And you saw the whole infinity of creation?"
"Sure. Really neat place, you know that?"
Gargravarr's mind was reeling in astonishment. Had his body been
with him it would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging
open.
"And you saw yourself," said Gargravarr, "in relation to it all?"
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"But ... what did you experience?"
Zaphod shrugged smugly.
"It just told me what I knew all the time. I'm a really terrific
and great guy. Didn't I tell you, baby, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox!"
His gaze passed over the machinery which powered the vortex and
suddenly stopped, startled.
He breathed heavily.
"Hey," he said, "is that really a piece of fairy cake?"
He ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors with
which it was surrounded.
"If I told you how much I needed this," he said ravenously, "I
wouldn't have time to eat it."
He ate it.
 A short while later he was running across the plain in the
direction of the ruined city.
The dank air wheezed heavily in his lungs and he frequently
stumbled with the exhaustion he was still feeling. Night was
beginning to fall too, and the rough ground was treacherous.
The elation of his recent experience was still with him though.
The whole Universe. He had seen the whole Universe stretching to
infinity around him - everything. And with it had come the clear
and extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing
in it. Having a conceited ego is one thing. Actually being told
by a machine is another.
He didn't have time to reflect on this matter.
Gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert his masters
as to what had happened, but that he was prepared to leave a
decent interval before doing so. Enough time for Zaphod to make a
break and find somewhere to hide.
What he was going to do he didn't know, but feeling that he was
the most important person in the Universe gave him the confidence
to believe that something would turn up.
Nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds
for optimism.
He ran on, and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city.
He walked along cracked and gaping roads riddled with scrawny
weeds, the holes filled with rotting shoes. The buildings he
passed were so crumbled and decrepit he thought it unsafe to
enter any of them. Where could he hide? He hurried on.
After a while the remains of a wide sweeping road led off from
the one down which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low
building, surrounded with sundry smaller ones, the whole
surrounded by the remains of a perimeter barrier. The large main
building still seemed reasonably solid, and Zaphod turned off to
see if it might provide him with ... well with anything.
He approached the building. Along one side of it - the front it
would seem since it faced a wide concreted apron area - were
three gigantic doors, maybe sixty feet high. The far one of these
was open, and towards this, Zaphod ran.
Inside, all was gloom, dust and confusion. Giant cobwebs lay over
everything. Part of the infrastructure of the building had
collapsed, part of the rear wall had caved in, and a thick
choking dust lay inches over the floor.
Through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with debris.
The shapes were sometimes cylindrical, sometimes bulbous,
sometimes like eggs, or rather cracked eggs. Most of them were
split open or falling apart, some were mere skeletons.
They were all spacecraft, all derelict.
Zaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks. There was nothing
here that remotely approached the serviceable. Even the mere
vibration of his footsteps caused one precarious wreck to
collapse further into itself.
Towards the rear of the building lay one old ship, slightly
larger than the others, and buried beneath even deeper piles of
dust and cobwebs. Its outline, however, seemed unbroken. Zaphod
approached it with interest, and as he did so, he tripped over an
old feedline.
He tried to toss the feedline aside, and to his surprise
discovered that it was still connected to the ship.
To his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was also
humming slightly.
He stared at the ship in disbelief, and then back down at the
feedline in his hands.
He tore off his jacket and threw it aside. Crawling along on his
hands and knees he followed the feedline to the point where it
connected with the ship. The connection was sound, and the slight
humming vibration was more distinct.
His heart was beating fast. He wiped away some grime and laid an
ear against the ship's side. He could only hear a faint,
indeterminate noise.
He rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor all
about him and found a short length of tubing, and a non-
biodegradable plastic cup. Out of this he fashioned a crude
stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship.
What he heard made his brains turn somersaults.
The voice said:
"Transtellar Cruise Lines would like to apologize to passengers
for the continuing delay to this flight. We are currently
awaiting the loading of our complement of small lemon-soaked
paper napkins for your comfort, refreshment and hygiene during
the journey. Meanwhile we thank you for your patience. The cabin
crew will shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again."
Zaphod staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship.
He walked around for a few moments in a daze. In so doing he
suddenly caught sight of a giant departure board still hanging,
but by only one support, from the ceiling above him. It was
covered with grime, but some of the figures were still
discernible.
Zaphod's eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some brief
calculations. His eyes widened.
"Nine hundred years ..." he breathed to himself. That was how
late the ship was.
Two minutes later he was on board.
As he stepped out of the airlock, the air that greeted him was
cool and fresh - the air conditioning was still working.
The lights were still on.
He moved out of the small entrance chamber into a short narrow
corridor and stepped nervously down it.
Suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him.
"Please return to your seat sir," said the android stewardess
and, turning her back on him, she walked on down the corridor in
front of him.
When his heart had started beating again he followed her. She
opened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through.
He followed her through the door.
They were now in the passenger compartment and Zaphod's heart
stopped still again for a moment.
In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat.
The passengers' hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were
long, the men wore beards.
All of them were quite clearly alive - but sleeping.
Zaphod had the creeping horrors.
He walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream. By the time he was
half-way down the aisle, the stewardess had reached the other
end. She turned and spoke.
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen," she said sweetly, "Thank
you for bearing with us during this slight delay. We will be
taking off as soon as we possibly can. If you would like to wake
up now I will serve you coffee and biscuits."
There was a slight hum.
At that moment, all the passengers awoke.
They awoke screaming and clawing at their straps and life support
systems that held them tightly in their seats. They screamed and
bawled and hollered till Zaphod thought his ears would shatter.
They struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently moved up
the aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits
in front of each one of them.
Then one of them rose from his seat.
He turned and looked at Zaphod.
Zaphod's skin was crawling all over his body as if it was trying
to get off. He turned and ran from the bedlam.
He plunged through the door and back into the corridor.
The man pursued him.
He raced in a frenzy to the end of the corridor, through the
entrance chamber and beyond. He arrived on the flight deck,
slammed and bolted the door behind him. He leant back against the
door breathing hard.
Within seconds, a hand started beating on the door.
From somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him.
"Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck. Please return to
your seat, and wait for the ship to take off. Coffee and biscuits
are being served. This is your autopilot speaking. Please return
to your seat."
Zaphod said nothing. He breathed hard, behind him, the hand
continued to knock on the door.
"Please return to your seat," repeated the autopilot. "Passengers
are not allowed on the flight deck."
"I'm not a passenger," panted Zaphod.
"Please return to your seat."
"I am not a passenger!" shouted Zaphod again.
"Please return to your seat."
"I am not a ... hello, can you hear me?"
"Please return to your seat."
You're the autopilot?" said Zaphod.
"Yes," said the voice from the flight console.
"You're in charge of this ship?"
"Yes," said the voice again, "there has been a delay. Passengers
are to be kept temporarily in suspended animation, for their
comfort and convenience. Coffee and biscuits are being served
every year, after which passengers are returned to suspended
animation for their continued comfort and convenience. Departure
will take place when the flight stores are complete. We apologize
for the delay."
Zaphod moved away from the door, on which the pounding had now
ceased. He approached the flight console.
"Delay?" he cried, "Have you seen the world outside this ship?
It's a wasteland, a desert. Civilization's been and gone, man.
There are no lemon-soaked paper napkins on the way from
anywhere!"
"The statistical likelihood," continued the autopilot primly, "is
that other civilizations will arise. There will one day be
lemon-soaked paper napkins. Till then there will be a short
delay. Please return to your seat."
"But ..."
But at that moment the door opened. Zaphod span round to see the
man who had pursued him standing there. He carried a large
briefcase. He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short. He had
no beard and no long fingernails.
"Zaphod Beeblebrox," he said, "My name is Zarniwoop. I believe
you wanted to see me."
Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered. His mouths said foolish things. He
dropped into a chair.
"Oh man, oh man, where did you spring from?" he said.
"I've been waiting here for you," he said in a businesslike tone.
He put the briefcase down and sat in another chair.
"I am glad you followed instructions," he said, "I was a bit
nervous that you might have left my office by the door rather
than the window. Then you would have been in trouble."
Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled.
"When you entered the door of my office, you entered my
electronically synthesized Universe," he explained, "if you had
left by the door you would have been back in the real one. The
artificial one works from here."
He patted the briefcase smugly.
Zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing.
"What's the difference?" he muttered.
"Nothing," said Zarniwoop, "they are identical. Oh - except that
I think the Frogstar Fighters are grey in the real Universe."
"What's going on?" spat Zaphod.
"Simple," said Zarniwoop. His self assurance and smugness made
Zaphod seethe.
"Very simple," repeated Zarniwoop, "I discovered the coordinated
at which this man could be found - the man who rules the
Universe, and discovered that his world was protected by an
Unprobability field. To protect my secret - and myself - I
retreated to the safety of this totally artificial Universe and
hid myself away in a forgotten cruise liner. I was secure.
Meanwhile, you and I ..."
"You and I?" said Zaphod angrily, "you mean I knew you?"
"Yes," said Zarniwoop, "we knew each other well."
"I had no taste," said Zaphod and resumed a sullen silence.
"Meanwhile, you and I arranged that you would steal the
Improbability Drive ship - the only one which could reach the
ruler's world - and bring it to me here. This you have now done I
trust, and I congratulate you." He smiled a tight little smile
which Zaphod wanted to hit with a brick.
"Oh, and in case you were wondering," added Zarniwoop, "this
Universe was created specifically for you to come to. You are
therefore the most important person in this Universe. You would
never," he said with an even more brickable smile, "have survived
the Total Perspective Vortex in the real one. Shall we go?"
"Where?" said Zaphod sullenly. He felt collapsed.
"To your ship. The Heart of Gold. You did bring it I trust?"
"No."
"Where is your jacket?"
Zaphod looked at him in mystification.
"My jacket? I took it off. It's outside."
"Good, we will go and find it."
Zarniwoop stood up and gestured to Zaphod to follow him.
Out in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of
the passengers being fed coffee and biscuits.
"It has not been a pleasant experience waiting for you," said
Zarniwoop.
"Not pleasant for you!" bawled Zaphod, "How do you think ..."
Zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung open.
A few feet away from them they could see Zaphod's jacket lying in
the debris.
"A very remarkable and very powerful ship," said Zarniwoop,
"watch."
As they watched, the pocket on the jacket suddenly bulged. It
split, it ripped. The small metal model of the Heart of Gold that
Zaphod had been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing.
It grew, it continued to grow. It reached, after two minutes, its
full size.
"At an Improbability Level," said Zarniwoop, "of ... oh I don't
know, but something very large."
Zaphod swayed.
"You mean I had it with me all the time?"
"Zarniwoop smiled. He lifted up his briefcase and opened it.
He twisted a single switch inside it.
"Goodbye artificial Universe," he said, "hello real one!"
The scene before them shimmered briefly - and reappeared exactly
as before.
"You see?" said Zarniwoop, "exactly the same."
 "You mean," repeated Zaphod tautly, "that I had it with me all
the time?"
"Oh yes," said Zarniwoop, "of course. That was the whole point."
"That's it," said Zaphod, "you can count me out, from hereon in
you can count me out. I've had all I want of this. You play your
own games."
"I'm afraid you cannot leave," said Zarniwoop, "you are entwined
in the Improbability field. You cannot escape."
He smiled the smile that Zaphod had wanted to hit and this time
Zaphod hit it.
Ford Prefect bounded up to the bridge of the Heart of Gold.
"Trillian! Arthur!" he shouted, "it's working! The ship's
reactivated!"
Trillian and Arthur were asleep on the floor.
"Come on you guys, we're going off, we're off," he said kicking
them awake.
"Hi there guys!" twittered the computer, "it's really great to be
back with you again, I can tell you, and I just want to say that
..."
"Shut up," said Ford, "tell us where the hell we are."
"Frogstar World B, and man it's a dump," said Zaphod running on
to the bridge, "hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me
you don't even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am."
"What a what?" said Arthur blearily, picking himself up from the
floor and not taking any of this in.
"I know how you feel," said Zaphod, "I'm so great even I get
tongue-tied talking to myself. Hey it's good to see you Trillian,
Ford, Monkeyman. Hey, er, computer ...?"
"Hi there, Mr Beeblebrox sir, sure is a great honor to ..."
"Shut up and get us out of here, fast fast fast."
"Sure thing, fella, where do you want to go?"
"Anywhere, doesn't matter," shouted Zaphod, "yes it does!" he
said again, "we want to go to the nearest place to eat!"
"Sure thing," said the computer happily and a massive explosion
rocket the bridge.
When Zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye, he
regarded the four wisps of smoke with interest.
Four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness. Consciousness
had died, cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the
pit of unbeing. The roar of silence echoed dismally around them
and they sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red
that slowly engulfed them, seemingly for ever.
After what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left them lying
on a cold hard shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of
Life, the Universe, and Everything.
Cold spasms shook them, lights danced sickeningly around them.
The cold hard shore tipped and span and then stood still. It
shone darkly - it was a very highly polished cold hard shore.
A green blur watched them disapprovingly.
It coughed.
"Good evening, madam, gentlemen," it said, "do you have a
reservation?"
Ford Prefect's consciousness snapped back like elastic, making
his brain smart. He looked up woozily at the green blur.
"Reservation?" he said weakly. "Yes, sir," said the green blur.
"Do you need a reservation for the afterlife?"
In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows
disdainfully, this is what the green blur now did.
"Afterlife, sir?" it said.
Arthur Dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one
grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath.
"Is this the afterlife?" he stammered.
"Well I assume so," said Ford Prefect trying to work out which
way was up. He tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite
direction from the cold hard shore on which he was lying, and
staggered to what he hoped were his feet.
"I mean," he said, swaying gently, "there's no way we could have
survived that blast is there?"
"No," muttered Arthur. He had raised himself on to his elbows but
it didn't seem to improve things. He slumped down again.
"No," said Trillian, standing up, "no way at all."
A dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor. It was Zaphod
Beeblebrox attempting to speak. "I certainly didn't survive," he
gurgled, "I was a total goner. Wham bang and that was it."
"Yeah, thanks to you," said Ford, "We didn't stand a chance. We
must have been blown to bits. Arms, legs everywhere."
"Yeah," said Zaphod struggling noisily to his feet.
"If the lady and gentlemen would like to order drinks ..." said
the green blur, hovering impatiently beside them.
"Kerpow, splat," continued Zaphod, "instantaneously zonked into
our component molecules. Hey, Ford," he said, identifying one of
the slowly solidifying blurs around him, "did you get that thing
of your whole life flashing before you?"
"You got that too?" said Ford, "your whole life?"
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "at least I assume it was mine. I spent a
lot of time out of my skulls you know."
He looked at around him at the various shapes that were at last
becoming proper shapes instead of vague and wobbling shapeless
shapes.
"So ..." he said.
"So what?" said Ford.
"So here we are," said Zaphod hesitantly, "lying dead ..."
"Standing," Trillian corrected him.
"Er, standing dead," continued Zaphod, "in this desolate ..."
"Restaurant," said Arthur Dent who had got to his feet and could
now, much to his surprise, see clearly. That is to say, the thing
that surprised him was not that he could see, but what he could
see.
"Here we are," continued Zaphod doggedly, "standing dead in this
desolate ..."
"Five star ..." said Trillian.
"Restaurant," concluded Zaphod.
"Odd isn't it?" said Ford.
"Er, yeah."
"Nice chandeliers though," said Trillian.
They looked about themselves in bemusement.
"It's not so much an afterlife," said Arthur, "more a sort of
apres vie."
The chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and the
low vaulted ceiling from which they hung would not, in an ideal
Universe, have been painted in that particular shade of deep
turquoise, and even if it had been it wouldn't have been
highlighted by concealed moodlighting. This is not, however, an
ideal Universe, as was further evidenced by the eye-crossing
patterns of the inlaid marble floor, and the way in which the
fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had been
made. The fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had
been made by stitching together nearly twenty thousand Antarean
Mosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that the twenty thousand
lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in.
A few smartly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar
or relaxing in the richly coloured body-hugging seats that were
deployed here and there about the bar area. A young Vl'Hurg
officer and his green steaming young lady passed through the
large smoked glass doors at the far end of the bar into the
dazzling light of the main body of the Restaurant beyond.
Behind Arthur was a large curtained bay window. He pulled aside
the corner of the curtain and looked out at a landscape which
under normal circumstances would have given Arthur the creeping
horrors. These were not, however, normal circumstances, for the
thing that froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl up his
back and off the top of his head was the sky. The sky was ...
An attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place.
"All in good time, sir," he said.
Zaphod's eyes flashed.
"Hey, hang about you dead guys," he said, "I think we're missing
some ultra-important thing here you know. Something somebody said
and we missed it."
Arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he
had just seen.
He said, "I said it was a sort of apres ..."
"Yeah, and don't you wish you hadn't?" said Zaphod, "Ford?"
"I said it was odd."
"Yeah, shrewd but dull, perhaps it was ..."
"Perhaps," interrupted the green blur who had by this time
resolved into the shape of a small wizened dark-suited green
waiter, "perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks
..."
"Drinks!" cried Zaphod, "that was it! See what you miss if you
don't stay alert."
"Indeed sir," said the waiter patiently. "If the lady and
gentlemen would care to order drinks before dinner ..."
"Dinner!" Zaphod exclaimed with passion, "Listen, little green
person, my stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night
for the mere idea."
"... and the Universe," concluded the waiter, determined not to
be deflected on his home stretch, "will explode later for your
pleasure."
Ford's head swivelled towards him. He spoke with feeling.
"Wow," he said, "What sort of drinks do you serve in this place?"
The waiter laughed a polite little waiter's laugh.
"Ah," he said, "I think sir has perhaps misunderstood me."
"Oh, I hope not," breathed Ford.
The waiter coughed a polite little waiter's cough.
"It is not unusual for our customers to be a little disoriented
by the time journey," he said, "so if I might suggest ..."
"Time journey?" said Zaphod.
"Time journey?" said Ford.
"Time journey?" said Trillian.
"You mean this isn't the afterlife?" said Arthur.
The waiter smiled a polite little waiter's smile. He had almost
exhausted his polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be
slipping into his role of a rather tight lipped and sarcastic
little waiter.
"Afterlife sir?" he said, "No sir."
"And we're not dead?" said Arthur.
The waiter tightened his lips.
"Aha, ha," he said, "Sir is most evidently alive, otherwise I
would not attempt to serve sir."
In an extraordinary gesture which is pointless attempting to
describe, Zaphod Beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two
of his arms and one of his thighs with the other.
"Hey guys," he said, "This is crazy. We finally did it. We
finally got to where we were going. This is Milliways!"
"Yes sir," said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel,
"this is Milliways - the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."
"End of what?" said Arthur.
"The Universe," repeated the waiter, very clearly and
unnecessarily distinctly.
"When did that end?" said Arthur.
"In just a few minutes, sir," said the waiter. He took a deep
breath. He didn't need to do this since his body was supplied
with the peculiar assortment of gases it required for survival
from a small intravenous device strapped to his leg. There are
times, however, when whatever your metabolism you have to take a
deep breath.
"Now, if you would care to order drinks at last," he said, "I
will then show you to your table."
Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over to the bar and
bought most of it.
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most
extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. It has
been built on the fragmented remains of ... it will be built on
the fragmented ... that is to say it will have been built by this
time, and indeed has been -
One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that
of accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no
problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a
broadminded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is
also no problem about changing the course of history - the course
of history does not change because it all fits together like a
jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things
they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the
end.
The major problem is quite simply one of grammar, and the main
work to consult in this matter is Dr Dan Streetmentioner's Time
Traveller's Handbook of Tense Formations. It will tell you
for instance how to describe something that was about to happen
to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping forward
two days in order to avoid it. The event will be described
differently according to whether you are talking about it from
the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the
further future, or a time in the further past and is further
complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst
you are actually travelling from one time to another with the
intention of becoming your own father or mother.
Most readers get as far as the Future Semi-Conditionally Modified
Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up:
and in fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond
this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.
The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this
tangle of academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the
term "Future Perfect" has been abandoned since it was discovered
not to be.
To resume:
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most
extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering.
It is built on the fragmented remains of an eventually ruined
planet which is (wioll haven be) enclosed in a vast time bubble
and projected forward in time to the precise moment of the End of
the Universe.
This is, many would say, impossible.
In it, guests take (willan on-take) their places at table and eat
(willan on-eat) sumptuous meals whilst watching (willing watchen)
the whole of creation explode around them.
This is, many would say, equally impossible.
You can arrive (mayan arivan on-when) for any sitting you like
without prior (late fore-when) reservation because you can book
retrospectively, as it were when you return to your own time.
(you can have on-book haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta
retrohome.)
This is, many would now insist, absolutely impossible.
At the Restaurant you can meet and dine with (mayan meetan con
with dinan on when) a fascinating cross-section of the entire
population of space and time.
This, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible.
You can visit it as many times as you like (mayan on-visit re-
onvisiting ... and so on - for further tense-corrections consult
Dr Streetmentioner's book) and be sure of never meeting yourself,
because of the embarrassment this usually causes.
This, even if the rest were true, which it isn't, is patently
impossible, say the doubters.
All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in
your own era, and when you arrive at the End of Time the
operation of compound interest means that the fabulous cost of
your meal has been paid for.
This, many claim, is not merely impossible but clearly insane,
which is why the advertising executives of the star system of
Bastablon came up with this slogan: "If you've done six
impossible things this morning, why not round it off with
breakfast at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the
Universe?"
At the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt. His
heads knocked together and his smiles were coming out of synch.
He was miserably happy.
"Zaphod," said Ford, "whilst you're still capable of speech,
would you care to tell me what the photon happened? Where have
you been? Where have we been? Small matter, but I'd like it
cleared up."
Zaphod's left head sobered up, leaving his right to sink further
into the obscurity of drink.
"Yeah," he said, "I've been around. They want me to find the man
who rules the Universe, but I don't care to meet him. I believe
the man can't cook."
His left head watched his right head saying this and then nodded.
"True," it said, "have another drink."
Ford had another Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, the drink which has
been described as the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging -
expensive and bad for the head. Whatever had happened, Ford
decided, he didn't really care too much.
"Listen Ford," said Zaphod, "everything's cool and froody."
"You mean everything's under control."
"No," said Zaphod, "I do not mean everything's under control.
That would not be cool and froody. If you want to know what
happened let's just say I had the whole situation in my pocket.
OK?"
Ford shrugged.
Zaphod giggled into his drink. It frothed up over the side of the
glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top.
A wild-skinned sky-gypsy approached them and played electric
violin at them until Zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed
to go away again.
The gypsy approached Arthur and Trillian sitting in another part
of the bar.
"I don't know what this place is," said Arthur, "but I think it
gives me the creeps."
"Have another drink," said Trillian, "Enjoy yourself."
"Which?" said Arthur, "the two are mutually exclusive."
"Poor Arthur, you're not really cut out for this life are you?"
"You call this life?"
"You're beginning to sound like Marvin."
"Marvin's the clearest thinker I know. How do you think we make
this violinist go away?"
The waiter approached.
"Your table is ready," he said.
Seen from the outside, which it never is, the Restaurant
resembles a giant glittering starfish beached on a forgotten
rock. Each of its arms houses the bars, the kitchens, the
forcefield generators which protect the entire structure and the
decayed planet on which it sits, and the Time Turbines which
slowly rock the whole affair backwards and forwards across the
crucial moment.
In the centre sits the gigantic golden dome, almost a complete
globe, and it was into this area that Zaphod, Ford, Arthur and
Trillian now passed.
At least five tons of glitter alone had gone into it before them,
and covered every available surface. The other surfaces were not
available because they were already encrusted with jewels,
precious sea shells from Santraginus, gold leaf, mosaic tiles,
lizard skins and a million unidentifiable embellishments and
decorations. Glass glittered, silver shone, gold gleamed, Arthur
Dent goggled.
"Wowee," said Zaphod, "Zappo."
"Incredible!" breathed Arthur, "the people ... ! The things ...
!"
"The things," said Ford Prefect quietly, "are also people."
"The people ..." resumed Arthur, "the ... other people ..."
"The lights ... !" said Trillian.
"The tables ..." said Arthur.
"The clothes ... !" said Trillian.
The waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs.
"The End of the Universe is very popular," said Zaphod threading
his way unsteadily through the throng of tables, some made of
marble, some of rich ultra-mahagony, some even of platinum, and
at each a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves
and studying menus.
"People like to dress up for it," continued Zaphod, "Gives it a
sense of occasion."
The tables were fanned out in a large circle around a central
stage area where a small band were playing light music, at least
a thousand tables was Arthur's guess, and interspersed amongst
them were swaying palms, hissing fountains, grotesque statuary,
in short all the paraphernalia common to all Restaurants where
little expense has been spared to give the impression that no
expense has been spared. Arthur glanced around, half expecting to
see someone making an American Express commercial.
Zaphod lurched into Ford, who lurched back into Zaphod.
"Wowee," said Zaphod.
"Zappo," said Ford.
"My great granddaddy must have really screwed up the computer's
works, you know," said Zaphod, "I told it to take us to the
nearest place to eat and it sends us to the End of the Universe.
Remind me to be nice to it one day."
He paused.
"Hey, everybody's here you know. Everybody who was anybody."
"Was?" said Arthur.
"At the End of the Universe you have to use the past tense a
lot," said Zaphod, "'cos everything's been done you know. Hi,
guys," he called out to a nearby party of giant iguana lifeforms,
"How did you do?"
"Is that Zaphod Beeblebrox?" asked one iguana of another iguana.
"I think so," replied the second iguana.
"Well doesn't that just take the biscuit," said the first iguana.
"Funny old thing, life," said the second iguana.
"It's what you make of it," said the first and they lapsed back
into silence. They were waiting for the greatest show in the
Universe.
"Hey, Zaphod," said Ford, grabbing for his arm and, on account of
the third Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, missing. He pointed a
swaying finger.
"There's an old mate of mine," he said, "Hotblack Desiato! See
the man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on?"
Zaphod tried to follow Ford's finger with his eyes but it made
him feel dizzy. Finally he saw.
"Oh yeah," he said, then recognition came a moment later. "Hey,"
he said, "did that guy ever make it megabig! Wow, bigger than the
biggest thing ever. Other than me."
"Who's he supposed to be?" asked Trillian.
"Hotblack Desiato?" said Zaphod in astonishment, "you don't know?
You never heard of Disaster Area?"
"No," said Trillian, who hadn't.
"The biggest," said Ford, "loudest ..."
"Richest ..." suggested Zaphod.
"... rock band in the history of ..." he searched for the word.
"... history itself," said Zaphod.
"No," said Trillian.
"Zowee," said Zaphod, "here we are at the End of the Universe and
you haven't even lived yet. Did you miss out."
He led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time
at the table. Arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone.
Ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance.
"Hey, er, Hotblack," he called out, "how you doing? Great to see
you big boy, how's the noise? You're looking great, really very,
very fat and unwell. Amazing." He slapped the man on the back and
was mildly surprised that it seemed to elict no response. The Pan
Galactic Gargle Blasters swirling round inside him told him to
plunge on regardless.
"Remember the old days?" he said, "We used to hang out, right?
The Bistro Illegal, remember? Slim's Throat Emporium? The
Evildrome Boozarama, great days eh?"
Hotblack Desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great
days or not. Ford was not perturbed.
"And when we were hungry we'd pose as public health inspectors,
you remember that? And go around confiscating meals and drinks
right? Till we got food poisoning. Oh, and then there were the
long nights of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above
the Cafe Lou in Gretchen Town, New Betel, and you were always in
the next room trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all
hated them. And you said you didn't care, and we said we did
because we hated them so much." Ford's eyes were beginning to
mist over.
"And you said you didn't want to be a star," he continued,
wallowing in nostalgia, "because you despised the star system.
And we said, Hadra and Sulijoo and me, that we didn't think you
had the option. And what do you do now? You buy star systems!"
He turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables.
"Here," he said, "is a man who buys star systems!"
Hotblack Desiato made no attempt either to confirm or deny this
fact, and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly.
"I think someone's drunk," muttered a purple bush-like being into
his wine glass.
Ford staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing
Hotblack Desiato.
"What's that number you do?" he said, unwisely grabbing at a
bottle for support and tipping it over - into a nearby glass as
it happened. Not to waste a happy accident, he drained the glass.
"That really huge number," he continued, "how does it go? Bwarm!
Bwarm! Baderr!!' something, and in the stage act you do it ends
up with this ship crashing right into the sun, and you actually
do it!"
Ford crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat
graphically. He knocked the bottle over again.
"Ship! Sun! Wham bang!" he cried. "I mean forget lasers and
stuff, you guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and
terrible songs."
His eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle
on to the table. Something ought to be done about it, he thought.
"Hey, you want a drink?" he said. It began to sink into his
squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and
that the missing something was in some way connected with the
fact that the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit
and the silvery trilby had not yet said "Hi, Ford" or "Great to
see you after all this time," or in fact anything at all. More to
the point he had not yet even moved.
"Hotblack?" said Ford.
A large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and pushed
him aside. He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to
see if he could spot the owner of this discourteous hand. The
owner was not hard to spot, on account of his being something of
the order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with it. In
fact he was built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy
and with lots of solid stuffing. The suit into which the man's
body had been stuffed looked as if it's only purpose in life was
to demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into
a suit. The face had the texture of an orange and the colour of
an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended.
"Kid ..." said a voice which emerged from the man's mouth as if
it had been having a really rough time down in his chest.
"Er, yeah?" said Ford conversationally. He staggered back to his
feet again and was disappointed that the top of his head didn't
come further up the man's body.
"Beat it," said the man.
"Oh yeah?" said Ford, wondering how wise he was being, "and who
are you?"
The man considered this for a moment. He wasn't used to being
asked this sort of question. Nevertheless, after a while he came
up with an answer.
"I'm the guy who's telling you to beat it," he said, "before you
get it beaten for you."
"Now listen," said Ford nervously - he wished his head would stop
spinning, settle down and get to grips with the situation - "Now
listen," he continued, "I am one of Hotblack's oldest friends and
..."
He glanced at Hotblack Desiato, who still hadn't moved so much as
an eyelash.
"... and ..." said Ford again, wondering what would be a good
word to say after "and".
The large man came up with a whole sentence to go after "and". He
said it.
"And I am Mr Desiato's bodyguard," it went, "and I am responsible
for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away
before it gets damaged."
"Now wait a minute," said Ford.
"No minutes!" boomed the bodyguard, "no waiting! Mr Desiato
speaks to no one!"
"Well perhaps you'd let him say what he thinks about the matter
himself," said Ford.
"He speaks to no one!" bellowed the bodyguard.
Ford glanced anxiously at Hotblack again and was forced to admit
to himself that the bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his
side. There was still not the slightest sign of movement, let
alone keen interest in Ford's welfare.
"Why?" said Ford, "What's the matter with him?"
The bodyguard told him.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a
plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally
held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but in
fact the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers
judge that the best sound balance is usually to be heard from
within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the
stage, whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments by
remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which
stays in orbit around the planet - or more frequently around a
completely different planet.
Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the
familiar theme of boy-being meets girl-being beneath a silvery
moon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason.
Many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for
artistic reasons, but most commonly because the band's public
address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations
treaties.
This has not, however, stopped their earnings from pushing back
the boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research
accountant has recently been appointed Professor of
Neomathematics at the University of Maximegalon, in recognition
of both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax
Returns, in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space-
time continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent.
Ford staggered back to the table where Zaphod, Arthur and
Trillian were sitting waiting for the fun to begin.
"Gotta have some food," said Ford.
"Hi, Ford," said Zaphod, "you speak to the big noise boy?"
Ford waggled his head noncommittally.
"Hotblack? I sort of spoke to him, yeah."
"What'd he say?"
"Well, not a lot really. He's ... er ..."
"Yeah?"
"He's spending a year dead for tax reasons. I've got to sit
down."
He sat down.
The waiter approached.
"Would you like to see the menu?" he said, "or would you like to
meet the Dish of the Day?"
"Huh?" said Ford.
"Huh?" said Arthur.
"Huh?" said Trillian.
"That's cool," said Zaphod, "we'll meet the meat."
In a small room in one of the arms of the Restaurant complex a
tall, thin, gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion
looked him in the face.
It was not a pretty face, perhaps because oblivion had looked him
in it so many times. It was too long for a start, the eyes too
sunken and too hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips were too
thin and too long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much
like a recently polished bay window. The hands that held the
curtain were long and thin too: they were also cold. They lay
lightly along the folds of the curtain and gave the impression
that if he didn't watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of
their own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner.
He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on
his features went off to play somewhere more healthy. He prowled
around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening's
preying, finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table,
where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes.
A bell rang.
He pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up. His hands
brushed limply over some of the one million rainbow-coloured
sequins with which his jacket was festooned, and he was gone
through the door.
In the Restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace,
a single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway
that led up to the centre of the stage.
Up the stairs bounded bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure.
He burst on to the stage, tripped lightly up to the microphone,
removed it from its stand with one swoop of his long thin hand
and stood for a moment bowing left and right to the audience
acknowledging their applause and displaying to them his bay
window. He waved to his particular friends in the audience even
though there weren't any there, and waited for the applause to
die down.
He held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not merely
from ear to ear, but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere
confines of his face.
"Thank you ladies and gentlemen!" he cried, "thank you very much.
Thank you so much."
He eyed them with a twinkling eye.
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "The Universe as we know it has
now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand
million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an
hour. So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the
End of the Universe!"
With a gesture he deftly conjured another round of spontaneous
applause. With another gesture he cut it.
"I am your host for tonight," he said, "my name is Max
Quordlepleen ..." (Everybody knew this, his act was famous
throughout the known Galaxy, but he said it for the fresh
applause it generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming
smile and wave.) "... and I've just come straight from the very
very other end of time, where I've been hosting a show at the Big
Bang Burger Bar - where I can tell you we had a very exciting
evening ladies and gentlemen - and I will be with you right
through this historic occasion, the End of History itself!"
Another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights dimmed
down further. On every table candles ignited themselves
spontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all the diners and
wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million
intimate shadows. A tremor of excitement thrilled through the
darkened Restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very
very slowly to dim, to darken, to fade.
Max's voice was hushed as he continued.
"So, ladies and gentlemen," he breathed, "the candles are lit,
the band plays softly, and as the force-shielded dome above us
fades into transparency, revealing a dark and sullen sky hung
heavy with the ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see
we're all in for a fabulous evening's apocalypse!"
Even the soft tootling of the band faded away as stunned shock
descended on all those who had not seen this sight before.
A monstrous, grisly light poured in on them,
- a hideous light,
- a boiling, pestilential light,
- a light that would have disfigured hell.
The Universe was coming to an end.
For a few interminable seconds the Restaurant span silently
through the raging void. Then Max spoke again.
"For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the end of
the tunnel," he said, "this is it."
The band struck up again.
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen," cried Max, "I'll be back with
you again in just a moment, and meanwhile I leave you in the very
capable hands of Mr Reg Nullify and his cataclysmic Combo. Big
hand please ladies and gentlemen for Reg and the boys!"
The baleful turmoil of the skies continued.
Hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a moment or so
normal conversation resumed. Max began his round of the tables,
swapping jokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living.
A large dairy animal approached Zaphod Beeblebrox's table, a
large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery
eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating
smile on its lips.
"Good evening," it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, "I
am the main Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my
body?" It harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind
quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at
them.
Its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur
and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger
from Zaphod Beeblebrox.
"Something off the shoulder perhaps?" suggested the animal,
"Braised in a white wine sauce?"
"Er, your shoulder?" said Arthur in a horrified whisper.
"But naturally my shoulder, sir," mooed the animal contentedly,
"nobody else's is mine to offer."
Zaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the
animal's shoulder appreciatively.
"Or the rump is very good," murmured the animal. "I've been
exercising it and eating plenty of grain, so there's a lot of
good meat there." It gave a mellow grunt, gurgled again and
started to chew the cud. It swallowed the cud again.
"Or a casserole of me perhaps?" it added.
"You mean this animal actually wants us to eat it?" whispered
Trillian to Ford.
"Me?" said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes, "I don't mean
anything."
"That's absolutely horrible," exclaimed Arthur, "the most
revolting thing I've ever heard."
"What's the problem Earthman?" said Zaphod, now transferring his
attention to the animal's enormous rump.
"I just don't want to eat an animal that's standing here inviting
me to," said Arthur, "it's heartless."
"Better than eating an animal that doesn't want to be eaten,"
said Zaphod.
"That's not the point," Arthur protested. Then he thought about
it for a moment. "Alright," he said, "maybe it is the point. I
don't care, I'm not going to think about it now. I'll just ... er
..."
The Universe raged about him in its death throes.
"I think I'll just have a green salad," he muttered.
"May I urge you to consider my liver?" asked the animal, "it must
be very rich and tender by now, I've been force-feeding myself
for months."
"A green salad," said Arthur emphatically.
"A green salad?" said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly
at Arthur.
"Are you going to tell me," said Arthur, "that I shouldn't have
green salad?"
"Well," said the animal, "I know many vegetables that are very
clear on that point. Which is why it was eventually decided to
cut through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that
actually wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly
and distinctly. And here I am."
It managed a very slight bow.
"Glass of water please," said Arthur.
"Look," said Zaphod, "we want to eat, we don't want to make a
meal of the issues. Four rare steaks please, and hurry. We
haven't eaten in five hundred and seventy-six thousand million
years."
The animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle.
"A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good," it said,
"I'll just nip off and shoot myself."
He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur.
"Don't worry, sir," he said, "I'll be very humane."
It waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen.
A matter of minutes later the waiter arrived with four huge
steaming steaks. Zaphod and Ford wolfed straight into them
without a second's hesitation. Trillian paused, then shrugged and
started into hers.
Arthur stared at his feeling slightly ill.
"Hey, Earthman," said Zaphod with a malicious grin on the face
that wasn't stuffing itself, "what's eating you?"
And the band played on.
All around the Restaurant people and things relaxed and chatted.
The air was filled with talk of this and that, and with the
mingled scents of exotic plants, extravagant foods and insidious
wines. For an infinite number of miles in every direction the
universal cataclysm was gathering to a stupefying climax.
Glancing at his watch, Max returned to the stage with a flourish.
"And now, ladies and gentlemen," he beamed, "is everyone having
one last wonderful time?"
"Yes," called out the sort of people who call out "yes" when
comedians ask them if they're having a wonderful time.
"That's wonderful," enthused Max, "absolutely wonderful. And as
the photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing
to tear apart the last of the red hot suns, I know you're all
going to settle back and enjoy with me what I know we will find
all an immensely exciting and terminal experience."
He paused. He caught the audience with a glittering eye.
"Believe me, ladies and gentlemen," he said, "there's nothing
penultimate about this one."
He paused again. Tonight his timing was immaculate. Time after
time he had done this show, night after night. Not that the word
night had any meaning here at the extremity of time. All there
was was the endless repetition of the final moment, as the
Restaurant rocked slowly forward over the brink of time's
furthest edge - and back again. This "night" was good though, the
audience was writhing in the palm of his sickly hand. His voice
dropped. They had to strain to hear him.
"This," he said, "really is the absolute end, the final chilling
desolation, in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes
extinct. This ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial it'."
He dropped his voice still lower. In the stillness, a fly would
not have dared cleat its throat.
"After this," he said, "there is nothing. Void. Emptiness.
Oblivion. Absolute nothing ..."
His eyes glittered again - or did they twinkle?"
"Nothing ... except of course for the sweet trolley, and a fine
selection of Aldebaran liqueurs!"
The band gave him a musical sting. He wished they wouldn't, he
didn't need it, not an artist of his calibre. He could play the
audience like his own musical instrument. They were laughing with
relief. He followed on.
"And for once," he cried cheerily, "you don't need to worry about
having a hangover in the morning - because there won't be any
more mornings!"
He beamed at his happy, laughing audience. He glanced up at the
sky, going through the same dead routine every night, but his
glance was only for a fraction of a second. He trusted it to do
its job, as one professional trusts another.
"And now," he said, strutting about the stage, "at the risk of
putting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here
this evening, I would like to welcome a few parties."
He pulled a card from his pocket.
"Do we have ..." he put up a hand to hold back the cheers, "Do we
have a party here from the Zansellquasure Flamarion Bridge Club
from beyond the Vortvoid of Qvarne? Are they here?"
A rousing cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear.
He peered around trying to find them.
"Are they here?" he asked again, to elict a louder cheer.
He got it, as he always did.
"Ah, there they are. Well, last bids lads - and no cheating,
remember this is a very solemn moment."
He lapped up the laughter.
"And do we also have, do we have ... a party of minor deities
from the Halls of Asgard?"
Away to his right came a rumble of thunder. Lightning arced
across the stage. A small group of hairy men with helmets sat
looking very pleased with themselves, and raised their glasses to
him.
Hasbeens, he thought to himself.
"Careful with that hammer, sir," he said.
They did their trick with the lightning again. Max gave them a
very thin lipped smile.
"And thirdly," he said, "thirdly a party of Young Conservatives
from Sirius B, are they here?"
A party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing rolls at
each other and started throwing rolls at the stage. They yapped
and barked unintelligibly.
"Yes," said Max, "well this is all your fault, you realize that?"
"And finally," said Max, quieting the audience down and putting
on his solemn face, "finally I believe we have with us here
tonight, a party of believers, very devout believers, from the
Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon."
There were about twenty of them, sitting right out on the edge of
the floor, ascetically dressed, sipping mineral water nervously,
and staying apart from the festivities. They blinked resentfully
as the spotlight was turned on them.
"There they are," said Max, "sitting there, patiently. He said
he'd come again, and he's kept you waiting a long time, so let's
hope he's hurrying fellas, because he's only got eight minutes
left!"
The party of Zarquon's followers sat rigid, refusing to be
buffeted by the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over
them.
Max restrained his audience.
"No, but seriously though folks, seriously though, no offence
meant. No, I know we shouldn't make fun of deeply held beliefs,
so I think a big hand please for the Great Prophet Zarquon ..."
The audience clapped respectfully.
"... wherever he's got to!"
He blew a kiss to the stony-faced party and returned to the
centre of the stage.
He grabbed a tall stool and sat on it.
"It's marvellous though," he rattled on, "to see so many of you
here tonight - no isn't it though? Yes, absolutely marvellous.
Because I know that so many of you come here time and time again,
which I think is really wonderful, to come and watch this final
end of everything, and then return home to your own eras ... and
raise families, strive for new and better societies, fight
terrible wars for what you know to be right ... it really gives
one hope for the future of all lifekind. Except of course," he
waved at the blitzing turmoil above and around them, "that we
know it hasn't got one ..."
Arthur turned to Ford - he hadn't quite got this place worked out
in his mind.
"Look, surely," he said, "if the Universe is about to end ...
don't we go with it?"
Ford gave him a three-Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster look, in other
words a rather unsteady one.
"No," he said, "look," he said, "as soon as you come into this
dive you get held in this sort of amazing force-shielded temporal
warp thing. I think."
"Oh," said Arthur. He turned his attention back to a bowl of soup
he'd managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak.
"Look," said Ford, "I'll show you."
He grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly with
it.
"Look," he said again, "imagine this napkin, right, as the
temporal Universe, right? And this spoon as a transductional mode
in the matter curve ..."
It took him a while to say this last part, and Arthur hated to
interrupt him.
"That's the spoon I was eating with," he said.
"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this spoon ..." he found a small
wooden spoon on a tray of relishes, "this spoon ..." but found it
rather tricky to pick up, "no, better still this fork ..."
"Hey would you let go of my fork?" snapped Zaphod.
"Alright," said Ford, "alright, alright. Why don't we say ... why
don't we say that this wine glass is the temporal Universe ..."
"What, the one you've just knocked on the floor?"
"Did I do that?"
"Yes."
"Alright," said Ford, "forget that. I mean ... I mean, look, do
you know - do you know how the Universe actually began for a kick
off?"
"Probably not," said Arthur, who wished he'd never embarked on
any of this.
"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this. Right. You get this bath.
Right. A large round bath. And it's made of ebony."
"Where from?" said Arthur, "Harrods was destroyed by the Vogons."
"Doesn't matter."
"So you keep saying."
"Listen."
"Alright."
"You get this bath, see? Imagine you've got this bath. And it's
ebony. And it's conical."
"Conical?" said Arthur, "What sort of ..."
"Shhh!" said Ford. "It's conical. So what you do is, you see, you
fill it with fine white sand, alright? Or sugar. Fine white sand,
and or sugar. Anything. Doesn't matter. Sugar's fine. And when
it's full, you pull the plug out ... are you listening?"
"I'm listening."
"You pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls away
you see, out of the plughole."
"I see."
"You don't see. You don't see at all. I haven't got to the clever
bit yet. You want to hear the clever bit?"
"Tell me the clever bit."
"I'll tell you the clever bit."
Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit
was.
"The clever bit," he said, "is this. You film it happening."
"Clever."
"That's not the clever bit. This is the clever bit, I remember
now that this is the clever bit. The clever bit is that you then
thread the film in the projector ... backwards!"
"Backwards?"
"Yes. Threading it backwards is definitely the clever bit. So
then, you just sit and watch it, and everything just appears to
spiral upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath. See?"
"And that's how the Universe began is it?" said Arthur.
"No," said Ford, "but it's a marvellous way to relax."
He reached for his wine glass.
"Where's my wine glass?" he said.
"It's on the floor."
"Ah."
Tipping back his chair to look for it, Ford collided with the
small green waiter who was approaching the table carrying a
portable telephone.
Ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because
he was extremely drunk.
The waiter said that that was quite alright and that he perfectly
understood.
Ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence, attempted to tug
his forelock, missed by six inches and slid under the table.
"Mr Zaphod Beeblebrox?" inquired the waiter.
"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, glancing up from his third steak.
"There is a phone call for you."
"Hey, what?"
"A phone call, sir."
"For me? Here? Hey, but who knows where I am?"
One of his minds raced. The other dawdled lovingly over the food
it was still shovelling in.
"Excuse me if I carry on, won't you?" said his eating head and
carried on.
There were now so many people after him he'd lost count. He
shouldn't have made such a conspicuous entrance. Hell, why not
though, he thought. How do you know you're having fun if there's
no one watching you have it?
"Maybe someone here tipped off the Galactic Police," said
Trillian. "Everyone saw you come in."
"You mean they want to arrest me over the phone?" said Zaphod,
"Could be. I'm a pretty dangerous dude when I'm concerned."
"Yeah," said a voice from under the table, "you go to pieces so
fast people get hit by the shrapnel."
"Hey, what is this, Judgment Day?" snapped Zaphod.
"Do we get to see that as well?" asked Arthur nervously.
"I'm in no hurry," muttered Zaphod, "OK, so who's the cat on the
phone?" He kicked Ford. "Hey get up there, kid," he said to him,
"I may need you."
"I am not," said the waiter, "personally acquainted with the
metal gentlemen in question, sir ..."
"Metal?"
"Yes, sir."
"Did you say metal?"
"Yes, sir. I said that I am not personally acquainted with the
metal gentleman in question ..."
"OK, carry on."
"But I am informed that he has been awaiting your return for a
considerable number of millennia. It seems you left here somewhat
precipitately."
"Left here?" said Zaphod, "are you being strange? We only just
arrived here."
"Indeed, sir," persisted the waiter doggedly, "but before you
arrived here, sir, I understand that you left here."
Zaphod tried this in one brain, then in the other.
"You're saying," he said, "that before we arrived here, we left
here?"
This is going to be a long night, thought the waiter.
"Precisely, sir," he said.
"Put your analyst on danger money, baby," advised Zaphod.
"No, wait a minute," said Ford, emerging above table level again,
"where exactly is here?"
"To be absolutely exact sir, it is Frogstar World B."
"But we just left there," protested Zaphod, "we left there and
came to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."
"Yes, sir," said the waiter, feeling that he was now into the
home stretch and running well, "the one was constructed on the
ruins of the other."
"Oh," said Arthur brightly, "you mean we've travelled in time but
not in space."
"Listen you semi-evolved simian," cut in Zaphod, "go climb a tree
will you?"
Arthur bristled.
"Go bang your heads together four-eyes," he advised Zaphod.
"No, no," the waiter said to Zaphod, "your monkey has got it
right, sir."
Arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing apposite, or indeed
coherent.
"You jumped forward ... I believe five hundred and seventy-six
thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place,"
explained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling that
he had finally won through against what had seemed to be
insuperable odds.
"That's it!" said Zaphod, "I got it. I told the computer to send
us to the nearest place to eat, that's exactly what it did. Give
or take five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years, we
never moved. Neat."
They all agreed this was very neat.
"But who," said Zaphod, "is the cat on the phone?"
"Whatever happened to Marvin?" said Trillian.
Zaphod clapped his hands to his heads.
"The Paranoid Android! I left him moping about on Frogstar B."
"When was this?"
"Well, er, five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years
ago I suppose," said Zaphod, "Hey, er, hand me the rap-rod, Plate
Captain."
The little waiter's eyebrows wandered about his forehead in
confusion.
"I beg your pardon, sir?" he said.
"The phone, waiter," said Zaphod, grabbing it off him. "Shee, you
guys are so unhip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off."
"Indeed, sir."
"Hey, Marvin, is that you?" said Zaphod into the phone, "How you
doing, kid?"
There was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line.
"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said.
Zaphod cupped his hands over the phone.
"It's Marvin," he said.
"Hey, Marvin," he said into the phone again, "we're having a
great time. Food, wine, a little personal abuse and the Universe
going foom. Where can we find you?"
Again the pause.
"You don't have to pretend to be interested in me you know," said
Marvin at last, "I know perfectly well I'm only a menial robot."
"OK, OK," said Zaphod, "but where are you?"
"Reverse primary thrust, Marvin,' that's what they say to me,
open airlock number three, Marvin. Marvin, can you pick up that
piece of paper?' Can I pick up that piece of paper! Here I am,
brain the size of a planet and they ask me to ..."
"Yeah, yeah," sympathized Zaphod hardly at all.
"But I'm quite used to being humiliated," droned Marvin, "I can
even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would
you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water? I've
got one ready. Wait a minute."
"Er, hey, Marvin ..." interrupted Zaphod, but it was too late.
Sad little clunks and gurgles came up the line.
"What's he saying?" asked Trillian.
"Nothing," said Zaphod, "he just phoned up to wash his head at
us."
"There," said Marvin, coming back on the line and bubbling a bit,
"I hope that gave satisfaction ..."
"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod, "now will you please tell us where you
are?"
"I'm in the car park," said Marvin.
"The car park?" said Zaphod, "what are you doing there?"
"Parking cars, what else does one do in a car park?"
"OK, hang in there, we'll be right down."
In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw down the phone
and wrote "Hotblack Desiato" on the bill.
"Come on guys," he said, "Marvin's in the car park. Let's get on
down."
"What's he doing in the car park?" asked Arthur.
"Parking cars, what else? Dum dum."
"But what about the End of the Universe? We'll miss the big
moment."
"I've seen it. It's rubbish," said Zaphod, "nothing but a gnab
gib."
"A what?"
"Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let's get zappy."
Few of the other diners paid them any attention as they weaved
their way through the Restaurant to the exit. Their eyes were
riveted on the horror of the skies.
"An interesting effect to watch for," Max was telling them, "is
in the upper left-hand quadrant of the sky, where if you look
very carefully you can see the star system Hastromil boiling away
into the ultra-violet. Anyone here from Hastromil?"
There were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere at
the back.
"Well," said Max beaming cheerfully at them, "it's too late to
worry about whether you left the gas on now."
The main reception foyer was almost empty but Ford nevertheless
weaved his way through it.
Zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred him into a
cubicle standing to one side of the entrance hall.
"What are you doing to him?" asked Arthur.
"Sobering him up," said Zaphod and pushed a coin into a slot.
Lights flashed, gases swirled.
"Hi," said Ford stepping out a moment later, "where are we
going?"
"Down to the car park, come on."
"What about the personnel Time Teleports?" said Ford, "Get us
straight back to the Heart of Gold."
"Yeah, but I've cooled on that ship. Zarniwoop can have it. I
don't want to play his games. Let's see what we can find."
A Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People
Transporter took them down deep into the substrata beneath the
Restaurant. They were glad to see it had been vandalized and
didn't try to make them happy as well as take them down.
At the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a blast of
cold stale air hit them.
The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete
wall with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for
all of fifty major lifeforms. Nevertheless, like every car park
in the Galaxy throughout the entire history of car parks, this
car park smelt predominantly of impatience.
They turned a corner and found themselves on a moving catwalk
that traversed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the
dim distance.
It was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship
belonging to one of the diners upstairs, some smallish and
utilitarian mass production models, others vast shining
limoships, the playthings of the very rich.
Zaphod's eyes sparkled with something that may or may not have
been avarice as he passed over them. In fact it's best to be
clear on this point - avarice is definitely what it was.
"There he is," said Trillian, "Marvin, down there."
They looked where she was pointing. Dimly they could see a small
metal figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner
of a giant silver suncruiser.
At short intervals along the moving catwalk, wide transparent
tubes led down to floor level. Zaphod stepped off the catwalk
into one and floated gently downwards. The others followed.
Thinking back to this later, Arthur Dent thought it was the
single most enjoyable experience of his travels in the Galaxy.
"Hey, Marvin," said Zaphod striding over towards to him, "Hey,
kid, are we pleased to see you."
Marvin turned, and in so far as it is possible for a totally
inert metal face to look reproachfully, this is what it did.
"No you're not," he said, "no one ever is."
"Suit yourself," said Zaphod and turned away to ogle the ships.
Ford went with him.
Only Trillian and Arthur actually went up to Marvin.
"No, really we are," said Trillian and patted him in a way that
he disliked intensely, "hanging around waiting for us all this
time."
"Five hundred and seventy-six thousand million, three thousand
five hundred and seventy-nine years," said Marvin, "I counted
them."
"Well, here we are now," said Trillian, felling - quite correctly
in Marvin's view - that it was a slightly foolish thing to say.
"The first ten million years were the worst," said Marvin, "and
the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third
million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit
of decline."
He paused just long enough to make them feel they ought to say
something, and then interrupted.
"It's the people you meet in this job that really get you down,"
he said and paused again.
Trillian cleared her throat.
"Is that ..."
"The best conversation I had was over forty million years ago,"
continued Marvin.
Again the pause.
"Oh d ..."
"And that was with a coffee machine."
He waited.
"That's a ..."
"You don't like talking to me do you?" said Marvin in a low
desolate tone.
Trillian talked to Arthur instead.
Further down the chamber Ford Prefect had found something of
which he very much liked the look, several such things in fact.
"Zaphod," he said in a quiet voice, "just look at some of these
little star trolleys ..."
Zaphod looked and liked.
The craft they were looking at was in fact pretty small but
extraordinary, and very much a rich kid's toy. It was not much to
look at. It resembled nothing so much as a paper dart about
twenty feet long made of thin but tough metal foil. At the rear
end was a small horizontal two-man cockpit. It had a tiny charm-
drive engine, which was not capable of moving it at any great
speed. The thing it did have, however, was a heat-sink.
The heat-sink had a mass of some two thousand billion tons and
was contained within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic
field situated half-way along the length of the ship, and this
heat-sink enabled the craft to be manoeuvred to within a few
miles of a yellow sun, there to catch and ride the solar flares
that burst out from its surface.
Flare-riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in
existence, and those who can dare and afford it are amongst the
most lionized men in the Galaxy. It is also of course
stupefyingly dangerous - those who don't die riding invariably
die of sexual exhaustion at one of the Daedalus Club's Apres-
Flare parties.
Ford and Zaphod looked and passed on.
"And this baby," said Ford, "the tangerine star buggy with the
black sunbusters ..."
Again, the star buggy was a small ship - a totally misnamed one
in fact, because the one thing it couldn't manage was
interstellar distances. Basically it was a sporty planet hopper
dolled up to something it wasn't. Nice lines though. They passed
on.
The next one was a big one and thirty yards long - a coach built
limoship and obviously designed with one aim in mind, that of
making the beholder sick with envy. The paintwork and accessory
detail clearly said "Not only am I rich enough to afford this
ship, I am also rich enough not to take it seriously." It was
wonderfully hideous.
"Just look at it," said Zaphod, "multi-cluster quark drive,
perspulex running boards. Got to be a Lazlar Lyricon custom job."
He examined every inch.
"Yes," he said, "look, the infra-pink lizard emblem on the
neutrino cowling. Lazlar's trade mark. The man has no shame."
"I was passed by one of these mothers once, out by the Axel
Nebula," said Ford, "I was going flat out and this thing just
strolled past me, star drive hardly ticking over. Just
incredible."
Zaphod whistled appreciatively.
"Ten seconds later", said Ford, "it smashed straight into the
third moon of Jaglan Beta."
"Yeah, right?"
"Amazing looking ship though. Looks like a fish, moves like a
fish, steers like a cow."
Ford looked round the other side.
"Hey, come and see," he called out, "there's a big mural painted
on this side. A bursting sun - Disaster Area's trade mark. This
must be Hotblack's ship. Lucky old bugger. They do this terrible
song you know which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun.
Meant to be an amazing spectacle. Expensive in stunt ships
though."
Zaphod's attention however was elsewhere. His attention was
riveted on the ship standing next to Hotblack Desiato's limo. His
mouths hung open.
"That," he said, "that ... is really bad for the eyes ..."
Ford looked. He too stood astonished.
It was a ship of classic, simple design, like a flattened salmon,
twenty yards long, very clean, very sleek. There was just one
remarkable thing about it.
"It's so ... black!" said Ford Prefect, "you can hardly make out
its shape ... light just seems to fall into it!"
Zaphod said nothing. He had simply fallen in love.
The blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost impossible
to tell how close you were standing to it.
"Your eyes just slide off it ..." said Ford in wonder. It was an
emotional moment. He bit his lip.
Zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a man possessed - or
more accurately like a man who wanted to possess. His hand
reached out to stroke it. His hand stopped. His hand reached out
to stroke it again. His hand stopped again.
"Come and feel the surface," he said in a hushed voice.
Ford put his hand out to feel it. His hand stopped.
"You ... you can't ..." he said.
"See?" said Zaphod, "it's just totally frictionless. This must be
one mother of a mover ..."
He turned to look at Ford seriously. At least, one of his heads
did - the other stayed gazing in awe at the ship.
"What do you reckon, Ford?" he said.
"You mean ... er ..." Ford looked over his shoulder. "You mean
stroll off with it? You think we should?"
"No."
"Nor do I."
"But we're going to, aren't we?"
"How can we not?"
They gazed a little longer, till Zaphod suddenly pulled himself
together.
"We better shift soon," he said. "In a moment or so the Universe
will have ended and all the Captain Creeps will be pouring down
here to find their bourge-mobiles."
"Zaphod," said Ford.
"Yeah?"
"How do we do it?"
"Simple," said Zaphod. He turned. "Marvin!" he called.
Slowly, laboriously, and with a million little clanking and
creaking noises that he had learned to simulate, Marvin turned
round to answer the summons.
"Come on over here," said Zaphod, "We've got a job for you."
Marvin trudged towards them.
"I won't enjoy it," he said.
"Yes you will," enthused Zaphod, "there's a whole new life
stretching out ahead of you."
"Oh, not another one," groaned Marvin.
"Will you shut up and listen!" hissed Zaphod, "this time there's
going to be excitement and adventure and really wild things."
"Sounds awful," Marvin said.
"Marvin! All I'm trying to ask you ..."
"I suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you?"
"What? Er ... yes. Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod jumpily. He
was keeping at least three eyes on the entrance. Time was short.
"Well I wish you'd just tell me rather than try to engage my
enthusiasm," said Marvin, "because I haven't got one."
He walked on up to the ship, touched it, and a hatchway swung
open.
Ford and Zaphod stared at the opening.
"Don't mention it," said Marvin, "Oh, you didn't." He trudged
away again.
Arthur and Trillian clustered round.
"What's happening?" asked Arthur.
"Look at this," said Ford, "look at the interior of this ship."
"Weirder and weirder," breathed Zaphod.
"It's black," said Ford, "Everything in it is just totally black
..."
In the Restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment after
which there wouldn't be any more moments.
All eyes were fixed on the dome, other than those of Hotblack
Desiato's bodyguard, which were looking intently at Hotblack
Desiato, and those of Hotblack Desiato himself which the
bodyguard had closed out of respect.
The bodyguard leaned forward over the table. Had Hotblack Desiato
been alive, he probably would have deemed this a good moment to
lean back, or even go for a short walk. His bodyguard was not a
man which improved with proximity. On account of his unfortunate
condition, however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally inert.
"Mr Desiato, sir?" whispered the bodyguard. Whenever he spoke, it
looked as if the muscles on either side of his mouth were
clambering over each other to get out of the way.
"Mr Desiato? Can you hear me?"
Hotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing.
"Hotblack?" hissed the bodyguard.
Again, quite naturally, Hotblack Desiato did not reply.
Supernaturally, however, he did.
On the table in front of him a wine glass rattled, and a fork
rose an inch or so and tapped against the glass. It settled on
the table again.
The bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt.
"It's time we get going, Mr Desiato," muttered the bodyguard,
"don't want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition. You
want to get to the next gig nice and relaxed. There was a really
big audience for it. One of the best. Kakrafoon. Five-hundred
seventy-six thousand and two million years ago. Had you will have
been looking forward to it?"
The fork rose again, waggled in a non-committal sort of way and
dropped again.
"Ah, come on," said the bodyguard, "it's going to have been
great. You knocked 'em cold." The bodyguard would have given Dr
Dan Streetmentioner an apoplectic attack.
"The black ship going into the sun always gets 'em, and the new
one's a beauty. Be real sorry to see it go. If we get on down
there, I'll set the black ship autopilot and we'll cruise off in
the limo. OK?"
The fork tapped once in agreement, and the glass of wine
mysteriously emptied itself.
The bodyguard wheeled Hotblack Desiato's chair out of the
Restaurant.
"And now," cried Max from the centre of the stage, "the moment
you've all been waiting for!" He flung his arms into the air.
Behind him, the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling
synthochords. Max had argued with them about this but they had
claimed it was in their contract that that's what they would do.
His agent would have to sort it out.
"The skies begin to boil!" he cried. "Nature collapses into the
screaming void! In twenty seconds' time, the Universe itself will
be at an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!"
The hideous fury of destruction blazed about them - and at that
moment a still small trumpet sounded as from an infinite
distance. Max's eyes swivelled round to glare at the band. None
of them seemed to be playing a trumpet. Suddenly a wisp of smoke
was swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him. The trumpet
was joined by more trumpets. Over five hundred times Max had done
this show, and nothing like this had ever happened before. He
drew back in alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so, a
figure slowly materialized inside, the figure of an ancient man,
bearded, robed and wreathed in light. In his eyes were stars and
on his brow a golden crown.
"What's this?" whispered Max, wild-eyed, "what's happening?"
At the back of the Restaurant the stony-faced party from the
Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt
ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying.
Max blinked in amazement. He threw up his arms to the audience.
"A big hand please, ladies and gentlemen," he hollered, "for the
Great Prophet Zarquon! He has come! Zarquon has come again!"
Thunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage and
handed his microphone to the Prophet.
Zarquon coughed. He peered round at the assembled gathering. The
stars in his eyes blinked uneasily. He handled the microphone
with confusion.
"Er ..." he said, "hello. Er, look, I'm sorry I'm a bit late.
I've had the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up
at the last moment."
He seemed nervous of the expectant awed hush. He cleared his
throat.
"Er, how are we for time?" he said, "have I just got a min-"
And so the Universe ended.
One of the major selling point of that wholly remarkable travel
book, the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, apart from its
relative cheapness and the fact that it has the words Don't Panic
written in large friendly letters on its cover, is its
compendious and occasionally accurate glossary. The statistics
relating to the geo-social nature of the Universe, for instance,
are deftly set out between pages nine hundred and thirty-eight
thousand and twenty-four and nine hundred and thirty-eight
thousand and twenty-six; and the simplistic style in which they
are written is partly explained by the fact that the editors,
having to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information off
the back of a packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it
with a few footnoted in order to avoid prosecution under the
incomprehensibly tortuous Galactic Copyright laws.
It is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the
book backwards in time through a temporal warp, and then
successfully sued the breakfast cereal company for infringement
of the same laws.
Here is a sample:
The Universe - some information to help you live in it.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy offers this definition of
the word "Infinite".
Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some. Much
bigger than that in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally
stunning size, "wow, that's big", time. Infinity is just so big
that by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic
multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the
sort of concept we're trying to get across here.
It is impossible to import things into an infinite area, there
being no outside to import things in from.
See imports.
It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply
because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in.
However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there
must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number
divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so
the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be
said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the
whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet
from time to time are merely the products of a deranged
imagination.
In fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the
Galaxy, but none of them count. The Altairan Dollar has recently
collapsed, the Flaninian Pobble Bead is only exchangeable for
other Flaninian Pobble Beads, and the Triganic Pu has its own
very special problems. Its exchange rate of eight Ningis to one
Pu is simple enough, but since a Ningi is a triangular rubber
coin six thousand eight hundred miles across each side, no one
has ever collected enough to own one Pu. Ningis are not
negotiable currency because the Galactibanks refuse to deal in
fiddling small change. From this basic premise it is very simple
to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged
imagination.
The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there
simply isn't a mirror big enough - see point one.
Well, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely because of
the total lack of money, trade, banks, art, or anything else that
might keep all the non-existent people of the Universe occupied.
However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now
because it really is terribly complicated. For further
information see Guide Chapters seven, nine, ten, eleven,
fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four
inclusive, and in fact most of the rest of the Guide.
The Restaurant continued existing, but everything else had
stopped. Temporal relastatics held it and protected it in a
nothingness that wasn't merely a vacuum, it was simply nothing -
there was nothing in which a vacuum could be said to exist.
The force-shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque, the
party was over, the diners were leaving, Zarquon had vanished
along with the rest of the Universe, the Time Turbines were
preparing to pull the Restaurant back across the brink of time in
readiness for the lunch sitting, and Max Quordlepleen was back in
his small curtained dressing room trying to raise his agent on
the tempophone.
In the car park stood the black ship, closed and silent.
In to the car park came the late Mr Hotblack Desiato, propelled
along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard.
They descended one of the tubes. As they approached the limoship
a hatchway swung down from its side, engaged the wheels of the
wheelchair and drew it inside. The bodyguard followed, and having
seen his boss safely connected up to his death-support system,
moved up to the small cockpit. Here he operated the remote
control system which activated the autopilot in the black ship
lying next to the limo, thus causing great relief to Zaphod
Beeblebrox who had been trying to start the thing for over ten
minutes.
The black ship glided smoothly forward out of its bay, turned,
and moved down the central causeway swiftly and quietly. At the
end it accelerated rapidly, flung itself into the temporal launch
chamber and began the long journey back into the distant past.
The Milliways Lunch Menu quotes, by permission, a passage from
the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The passage is this:
The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass
through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of
Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How,
Why and Where phases.
For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question
"How can we eat?", the second by the question "Why do we eat?"
and the third by the question, "Where shall we have lunch?"
The Menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the
End of the Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated
answer to that third question.
What it doesn't go on to say is that though it will usually take
a large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the
How, Why and Where phases, small social groupings under stressful
conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity.
"How are we doing?" said Arthur Dent.
"Badly," said Ford Prefect.
"Where are we going?" said Trillian.
"I don't know," said Zaphod Beeblebrox.
"Why not?" demanded Arthur Dent.
"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect.
"Basically, what you're trying to say," said Arthur Dent,
ignoring this suggestion, "is that we're out of control."
The ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford and Zaphod
tried to wrest control from the autopilot. The engined howled and
whined like tired children in a supermarket.
"It's the wild colour scheme that freaks me," said Zaphod whose
love affair with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into
the flight, "Every time you try to operate on of these weird
black controls that are labelled in black on a black background,
a little black light lights up black to let you know you've done
it. What is this? Some kind of galactic hyperhearse?"
The walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the ceiling was
black, the seats - which were rudimentary since the only
important trip this ship was designed for was supposed to be
unmanned - were black, the control panel was black, the
instruments were black, the little screws that held them in place
were black, the thin tufted nylon floor covering was black, and
when they had lifted up a corner of it they had discovered that
the foam underlay also was black.
"Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different
wavelengths," offered Trillian.
"Or didn't have much imagination," muttered Arthur.
"Perhaps," said Marvin, "he was feeling very depressed."
In fact, though they weren't to know it, the decor had been
chosen in honour of its owner's sad, lamented, and tax-deductible
condition.
The ship gave a particularly sickening lurch.
"Take it easy," pleaded Arthur, "you're making me space sick."
"Time sick," said Ford, "we're plummeting backwards through
time."
"Thank you," said Arthur, "now I think I really am going to be
ill."
"Go ahead," said Zaphod, "we could do with a little colour about
this place."
"This is meant to be a polite after-dinner conversation is it?"
snapped Arthur.
Zaphod left the controls for Ford to figure out, and lurched over
to Arthur.
"Look, Earthman," he said angrily, "you've got a job to do,
right? The Question to the Ultimate Answer, right?"
"What, that thing?" said Arthur, "I thought we'd forgotten about
that."
"Not me, baby. Like the mice said, it's worth a lot of money in
the right quarters. And it's all locked up in that head thing of
yours."
"Yes but ..."
"But nothing! Think about it. The Meaning of Life! We get our
fingers on that we can hold every shrink in the Galaxy up to
ransom, and that's worth a bundle. I owe mine a mint."
Arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm.
"Alright," he said, "but where do we start? How should I know?
They say the Ultimate Answer or whatever is Forty-two, how am I
supposed to know what the question is? It could be anything. I
mean, what's six times seven?"
Zaphod looked at him hard for a moment. Then his eyes blazed with
excitement.
"Forty-two!" he cried.
Arthur wiped his palm across his forehead.
"Yes," he said patiently," I know that."
Zaphod's faces fell.
"I'm just saying that the question could be anything at all,"
said Arthur, "and I don't see how I am meant to know."
"Because," hissed Zaphod, "you were there when your planet did
the big firework."
"We have a thing on Earth ..." began Arthur.
"Had," corrected Zaphod.
"... called tact. Oh never mind. Look, I just don't know."
A low voice echoed dully round the cabin.
"I know," said Marvin.
Ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a losing
battle with.
"Stay out of this Marvin," he said, "this is organism talk."
"It's printed in the Earthman's brainwave patterns," continued
Marvin, "but I don't suppose you'll be very interested in knowing
that."
"You mean," said Arthur, "you mean you can see into my mind?"
"Yes," said Marvin.
Arthur stared in astonishment.
"And ...?" he said.
"It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small."
"Ah," said Arthur, "abuse."
"Yes," confirmed Marvin.
"Ah, ignore him," said Zaphod, "he's only making it up."
"Making it up?" said Marvin, swivelling his head in a parody of
astonishment, "Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad
enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it."
"Marvin," said Trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she
was still capable of assuming in talking to this misbegotten
creature, "if you knew all along, why then didn't you tell us?"
Marvin's head swivelled back to her.
"You didn't ask," he said simply.
"Well, we're asking you now, metal man," said Ford, turning round
to look at him.
At that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying, the
engine pitch settled down to a gentle hum.
"Hey, Ford," said Zaphod, "that sounds good. Have you worked out
the controls of this boat?"
"No," said Ford, "I just stopped fiddling with them. I reckon we
just go to wherever this ship is going and get off it fast."
"Yeah, right," said Zaphod.
"I could tell you weren't really interested," murmured Marvin to
himself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off.
"Trouble is," said Ford, "that the one instrument in this while
ship that is giving any reading is worrying me. If it is what I
think it is, and if it's saying what I think it's saying, then
we've already gone too far back into the past. Maybe as much as
two million years before our own time."
Zaphod shrugged.
"Time is bunk," he said.
"I wonder who this ship belongs to anyway," said Arthur.
"Me," said Zaphod.
"No. Who it really belongs to."
"Really me," insisted Zaphod, "look, property is theft, right?
Therefore theft is property. Therefore this ship is mine, OK?"
"Tell the ship that," said Arthur.
Zaphod strode over to the console.
"Ship," he said, banging on the panels, "this is your new owner
speaking to ..."
He got no further. Several things happened at once.
The ship dropped out fo time travel mode and re-emerged into real
space.
All the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the
time trip now lit up.
A large vision screen above the console winked into life
revealing a wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead
of them.
None of these things, however, were responsible for the fact that
Zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the
rear of the cabin, as were all the others.
They were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that
thuddered out of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision
screen.
Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in the middle of the
vast Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound
system.
That is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the stage
technicians. They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area's
giant control ship which hung in orbit some four hundred miles
above the surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound
system from there. Anyone within five miles of the speaker silos
wouldn't have survived the tuning up.
If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos
then his expiring thought would have been that in both size and
shape the sound rig closely resembled Manhattan. Risen out of the
silos, the neutron phase speaker stacks towered monstrously
against the sky, obscuring the banks of plutonium reactors and
seismic amps behind them.
Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay
the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship,
the massive photon-ajuitar, the bass detonator and the Megabang
drum complex.
It was going to be a noisy show.
Aboard the giant control ship, all was activity and bustle.
Hotblack Desiato's limoship, a mere tadpole beside it, had
arrived and docked, and the lamented gentleman was being
transported down the high vaulted corridors to meet the medium
who was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar
keyboard.
A doctor, a logician and a marine biologist had also just
arrived, flown in at phenomenal expense from Maximegalon to try
to reason with the lead singer who had locked himself in the
bathroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till
it could be proved conclusively to him that he wasn't a fish. The
bass player was busy machine-gunning his bedroom and the drummer
was nowhere on board.
Frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on a
beach on Santraginus V over a hundred light years away where, he
claimed, he had been happy over half an hour now and had found a
small stone that would be his friend.
The band's manager was profoundly relieved. It meant that for the
seventeenth time on this tour the drums would be played by a
robot and that therefore the timing of the cymbalistics would be
right.
The sub-ether was buzzing with the communications of the stage
technicians testing the speaker channels, and this it was that
was being relayed to the interior of the black ship.
Its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the cabin, and
listened to the voices on the monitor speakers.
"OK, channel nine on power," said a voice, "testing channel
fifteen ..."
Another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship.
"Channel fifteen AOK," said another voice.
A third voice cut in.
"The black stunt ship is now in position," it said, "it's looking
good. Gonna be a great sundive. Stage computer on line?"
A computer voice answered.
"On line," it said.
"Take control of the black ship."
"Black ship locked into trajectory programme, on standby."
"Testing channel twenty."
Zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched frequencies on the
sub-ether receiver before the next mind-pulverizing noise hit
them. He stood there quivering.
"What," said Trillian in a small quiet voice, "does sundive
mean?"
"It means," said Marvin, "that the ship os going to dive into the
sun. Sun ... Dive. It's very simple to understand. What do you
expect if you steal Hotblack Desiato's stunt ship?"
"How do you know ..." said Zaphod in a voice that would make a
Vegan snow lizard feel chilly, "that this is Hotblack Desiato's
stuntship?"
"Simple," said Marvin, "I parked it for him."
"The why ... didn't ... you ... tell us!"
"You said you wanted excitement and adventure and really wild
things."
"This is awful," said Arthur unnecessarily in the pause which
followed.
"That's what I said," confirmed Marvin.
On a different frequency, the sub-ether receiver had picked up a
public broadcast, which now echoed round the cabin.
"... fine weather for the concert here this afternoon. I'm
standing here in front of the stage," the reporter lied, "in the
middle of the Rudlit Desert, and with the aid of hyperbinoptic
glasses I can just about make out the huge audience cowering
there on the horizon all around me. Behind me the speaker stacks
rise like a sheer cliff face, and high above me the sun is
shining away and doesn't know what's going to hit it. The
environmentalist lobby do know what's going to hit it, and they
claim that the concert will cause earthquakes, tidal waves,
hurricanes, irreparable damage to the atmosphere, and all the
usual things that environmentalists usually go on about.
"But I've just had a report that a representative of Disaster
Area met with the environmentalists at lunchtime, and had them
all shot, so nothing now lies in the way of ..."
Zaphod switched it off. He turned to Ford.
"You know what I'm thinking?" he said.
"I think so," said Ford.
"Tell me what you think I'm thinking."
"I think you're thinking it's time we get off this ship."
"I think you're right," said Zaphod.
"I think you're right," said Ford.
"How?" said Arthur.
"Quiet," said Ford and Zaphod, "we're thinking."
"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die."
"I wish you'd stop saying that," said Ford.
It is worth repeating at this point the theories that Ford had
come up with, on his first encounter with human beings, to
account for their peculiar habit of continually stating and
restating the very very obvious, as it 'It's a nice day," or
"You're very tall," or "So this is it, we're going to die."
His first theory was that if human beings didn't keep exercising
their lips, their mouths probably seized up.
After a few months of observation he had come up with a second
theory, which was this - "If human beings don't keep exercising
their lips, their brains start working."
In fact, this second theory is more literally true of the
Belcebron people of Kakrafoon.
The Belcebron people used to cause great resentment and
insecurity amongst neighboring races by being one of the most
enlightened, accomplished, and above all quiet civilizations in
the Galaxy.
As a punishment for this behaviour, which was held to be
offensively self righteous and provocative, a Galactic Tribunal
inflicted on them that most cruel of all social diseases,
telepathy. Consequently, in order to prevent themselves
broadcasting every slightest thought that crossed their minds to
anyone within a five mile radius, they now have to talk very
loudly and continuously about the weather, their little aches and
pains, the match this afternoon and what a noisy place Kakrafoon
had suddenly become.
Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play
host to a Disaster Area concert.
The timing of the concert was critical.
The ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in order
to hit the sun six minutes and thirty-seven seconds before the
climax of the song to which it related, so that the light of the
solar flares had time to travel out to Kakrafoon.
The ship had already been diving for several minutes by the time
that Ford Prefect had completed his search of the other
compartments of the black ship. He burst back into the cabin.
The sun of Kakrafoon loomed terrifyingly large on the vision
screen, its blazing white inferno of fusing hydrogen nuclei
growing moment by moment as the ship plunged onwards, unheeding
the thumping and banging of Zaphod's hands on the control panel.
Arthur and Trillian had the fixed expressions of rabbits on a
night road who think that the best way of dealing with
approaching headlights is to stare them out.
Zaphod span round, wild-eyed.
"Ford," he said, "how many escape capsules are there?"
"None," said Ford.
Zaphod gibbered.
"Did you count them?" he yelled.
"Twice," said Ford, "did you manage to raise the stage crew on
the radio?"
"Yeah," said Zaphod, bitterly, "I said there were a whole bunch
of people on board, and they said to say hi' to everybody."
Ford goggled.
"Didn't you tell them who we were?"
"Oh yeah. They said it was a great honour. That and something
about a restaurant bill and my executors."
Ford pushed Arthur aside and leaned forward over the control
console.
"Does none of this function?" he said savagely.
"All overridden."
"Smash the autopilot."
"Find it first. Nothing connects."
There was a moment's cold silence.
Arthur was stumbling round the back of the cabin. He stopped
suddenly.
"Incidentally," he said, "what does teleport mean?"
Another moment passed.
Slowly, the others turned to face him.
"Probably the wrong moment to ask," said Arthur, "It's just I
remember hearing you use the word a short while ago and I only
bring it up because ..."
"Where," said Ford Prefect quietly, "does it say teleport?"
"Well, just over here in fact," said Arthur, pointing at a dark
control box in the rear of the cabin, "Just under the word
emergency', above the word system' and beside the sign saying
out of order'."
In the pandemonium that instantly followed, the only action to
follow was that of Ford Prefect lunging across the cabin to the
small black box that Arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly
at the single small black button set into it.
A six-foot square panel slid open beside it revealing a
compartment which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found
a new function in life as an electrician's junk store. Half-
finished wiring hung from the ceiling, a jumble of abandoned
components lay strewn on the floor, and the programming panel
lolled out of the cavity in the wall into which it should have
been secured.
A junior Disaster Area accountant, visiting the shipyard where
this ship was being constructed, had demanded to know of the
works foreman why the hell they were fitting an extremely
expensive teleport into a ship which only had one important
journey to make, and that unmanned. The foreman had explained
that the teleport was available at a ten per cent discount and
the accountant had explained that this was immaterial; the
foreman had explained that it was the finest, most powerful and
sophisticated teleport that money could buy and the accountant
had explained that the money did not wish to buy it; the foreman
had explained that people would still need to enter and leave the
ship and the accountant had explained that the ship sported a
perfectly serviceable door; the foreman had explained that the
accountant could go and boil his head and the accountant had
explained to the foreman that the thing approaching him rapidly
from his left was a knuckle sandwich. After the explanations had
been concluded, work was discontinued on the teleport which
subsequently passed unnoticed on the invoice as "Sund. explns."
at five times the price.
"Hell's donkeys," muttered Zaphod as he and Ford attempted to
sort through the tangle of wiring.
After a moment or so Ford told him to stand back. He tossed a
coin into the teleport and jiggled a switch on the lolling
control panel. With a crackle and spit of light, the coin
vanished.
"That much of it works," said Ford, "however, there is no
guidance system. A matter transference teleport without guidance
programming could put you ... well, anywhere."
The sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen.
"Who cares," said Zaphod, "we go where we go."
"And," said Ford, "there is no autosystem. We couldn't all go.
Someone would have to stay and operate it."
A solemn moment shuffled past. The sun loomed larger and larger.
"Hey, Marvin kid," said Zaphod brightly, "how you doing?"
"Very badly I suspect," muttered Marvin.
A shortish while later, the concert on Kakrafoon reached an
unexpected climax.
The black ship with its single morose occupant had plunged on
schedule into the nuclear furnace of the sun. Massive solar
flares licked out from it millions of miles into space, thrilling
and in a few cases spilling the dozen or so Flare Riders who had
been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of
the moment.
Moments before the flare light reached Kakrafoon the pounding
desert cracked along a deep faultline. A huge and hitherto
undetected underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed
to the surface to be followed seconds later by the eruption of
millions of tons of boiling lava that flowed hundreds of feet
into the air, instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and
below the surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side of
the world and back again.
Those - very few - who witnessed the event and survived swear
that the whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose
into the air like a mile-thick pancake, flipped itself over and
fell back down. At that precise moment the solar radiation from
the flares filtered through the clouds of vaporized water and
struck the ground.
A year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert was thick
with flowers. The structure of the atmosphere around the planet
was subtly altered. The sun blazed less harshly in the summer,
the cold bit less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more
often, and slowly the desert world of Kakrafoon became a
paradise. Even the telepathic power with which the people of
Kakrafoon had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the force
of the explosion.
A spokesman for Disaster Area - the one who had had all the
environmentalists shot - was later quoted as saying that it had
been "a good gig".
Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A few
sceptical scientists examined the records of the events more
closely, and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a
vast artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a
nearby region of space.
Arthur woke up and instantly regretted it. Hangovers he'd had,
but never anything on this scale. This was it, this was the big
one, this was the ultimate pits. Matter transference beams, he
decided, were not as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the
head.
Being for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull
stomping throb he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought.
The trouble with most forms of transport, he thought, is
basically one of them not being worth all the bother. On Earth -
when there had been an Earth, before it was demolished to make
way for a new hyperspace bypass - the problem had been with cars.
The disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime
from out of the ground where it had been safely hidden out of
harm's way, turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke to
fill the air with and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed
to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from
one place to another - particularly when the place you arrived at
had probably become, as a result of this, very similar to the
place you had left, i.e. covered with tar, full of smoke and
short of fish.
And what about matter transference beams? Any form of transport
which involved tearing you apart atom by atom, flinging those
atoms through the sub-ether, and then jamming them back together
again just when they were getting their first taste of freedom
for years had to be bad news.
Many people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent and had
even gone to the lengths of writing songs about it. Here is one
that used regularly to be chanted by huge crowds outside the
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Teleport Systems factory on
Happi-Werld :
Aldebaran's great, OK,
Algol's pretty neat,
Betelgeuse's pretty girls,
Will knock you off your feet.
They'll do anything you like,
Real fast and then real slow,
But if you have to take me apart to get me there,
Then I don't want to go.
Singing,
Take me apart, take me apart,
What a way to roam,
And if you have to take me apart to get me there,
I'd rather stay at home.
Sirius is paved with gold
So I've heard it said
By nuts who then go on to say
"See Tau before you're dead."
I'll gladly take the high road
Or even take the low,
But if you have to take me apart to get me there,
Then I, for one, won't go.
Singing,
Take me apart, take me apart, You must be off your head,
And if you try to take me apart to get me there,
I'll stay right here in bed.
I teleported home one night,
With Ron and Sid and Meg,
Ron stole Meggie's heart away,
And I got Sidney's leg.
Arthur felt the waves of pain slowly receding, though he was
still aware of a dull stomping throb. Slowly, carefully, he stood
up.
"Can you hear a dull stomping throb?" said Ford Prefect.
Arthur span round and wobbled uncertainly. Ford Prefect was
approaching looking red eyed and pasty.
"Where are we?" gasped Arthur.
Ford looked around. They were standing in a long curving corridor
which stretched out of sight in both directions. The outer steel
wall - which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which
they use in schools, hospitals and mental asylums to keep the
inmates subdued - curved over the tops of their heads where it
met the inner perpendicular wall which, oddly enough was covered
in dark brown hessian wall weave. The floor was of dark green
ribbed rubber.
Ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the
outer wall. It was several layers deep, yet through it he could
see pinpoints of distant stars.
"I think we're in a spaceship of some kind," he said.
Down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb.
"Trillian?" called Arthur nervously, "Zaphod?"
Ford shrugged.
"Nowhere about," he said, "I've looked. They could be anywhere.
An unprogrammed teleport can throw you light years in any
direction. Judging by the way I feel I should think we've
travelled a very long way indeed."
"How do you feel?"
"Bad."
"Do you think they're ..."
"Where they are, how they are, there's no way we can know and no
way we can do anything about it. Do what I do."
"What?"
"Don't think about it."
Arthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw the
wisdom of it, tucked it up and put it away. He took a deep
breath.
"Footsteps!" exclaimed Ford suddenly.
"Where?"
"That noise. That stomping throb. Pounding feet. Listen!"
Arthur listened. The noise echoed round the corridor at them from
an indeterminate distance. It was the muffled sound of pounding
footsteps, and it was noticeably louder.
"Let's move," said Ford sharply. They both moved - in opposite
directions.
"Not that way," said Ford, "that's where they're coming from."
"No it's not," said Arthur, "They're coming from that way."
"They're not, they're ..."
They both stopped. They both turned. They both listened intently.
They both agreed with each other. They both set off into opposite
directions again.
Fear gripped them.
From both directions the noise was getting louder.
A few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to
the inner wall. They ran to it and hurried along it. It was dark,
immensely long and, as they passed down it, gave them the
impression that it was getting colder and colder. Other corridors
gave off it to the left and right, each very dark and each
subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed.
They stopped for a moment in alarm. The further down the corridor
they went, the louder became the sound of pounding feet.
They pressed themselves back against the cold wall and listened
furiously. The cold, the dark and the drumming of disembodied
feet was getting to them badly. Ford shivered, partly with the
cold, but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother
used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle
high to an Arcturan Megagrasshopper: stories of dead ships,
haunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the obscurer regions
of deep space infested with demons or the ghosts of forgotten
crews; stories too of incautious travellers who found and entered
such ships; stories of ... - then Ford remembered the brown
hessian wall weave in the first corridor and pulled himself
together. However ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their
death hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay any money you
liked it wasn't with hessian wall weave. He grasped Arthur by the
arm.
"Back the way we came," he said firmly and they started to
retrace their steps.
A moment later they leap like startled lizards down the nearest
corridor junction as the owners of the drumming feet suddenly
hove into view directly in front of them.
Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two
dozen overweight men and women pounded past them in track suits
panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon
gibber.
Ford Prefect stared after them.
"Joggers!" he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed away up
and down the network of corridors.
"Joggers?" whispered Arthur Dent.
"Joggers," said Ford prefect with a shrug.
The corridor they were concealed in was not like the others. It
was very short, and ended at a large steel door. Ford examined
it, discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide.
The first thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a
coffin.
And the next four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine things
that hit their eyes were also coffins.
The vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic. At the far
end, about three hundred yards away an archway let through to
what appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied.
Ford Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on to the
floor of the vault.
"Wild," he said.
"What's so great about dead people?" asked Arthur, nervously
stepping down after him.
"Dunno," said Ford, "Let's find out shall we?"
On closer inspection the coffins seemed to be more like
sarcophagi. They stood about waist high and were constructed of
what appeared to be white marble, which is almost certainly what
it was - something that only appeared to be white marble. The
tops were semi-translucent, and through them could dimly be
perceived the features of their late and presumably lamented
occupants. They were humanoid, and had clearly left the troubles
of whatever world it was they came from far behind them, but
beyond that little else could be discerned.
Rolling slowly round the floor between the sarcophagi was a
heavy, oily white gas which Arthur at first thought might be
there to give the place a little atmosphere until he discovered
that it also froze his ankles. The sarcophagi too were intensely
cold to the touch.
Ford suddenly crouched down beside one of them. He pulled a
corner of his towel out of his satchel and started to rub
furiously at something.
"Look, there's a plaque on this one," he explained to Arthur,
"It's frosted over."
He rubbed the frost clear and examined the engraved characters.
To Arthur they looked like the footprints of a spider that had
had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on a night
out, but Ford instantly recognized an early form of Galactic
Eezeereed.
"It says Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven, Telephone
Sanitizer Second Class' - and a serial number."
"A telephone sanitizer?" said Arthur, "a dead telephone
sanitizer?"
"Best kind."
"But what's he doing here?"
Ford peered through the top at the figure within.
"Not a lot," he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins of
his which always made people think he'd been overdoing things
recently and should try to get some rest.
He scampered over to another sarcophagus. A moment's brisk towel
work and he announced:
"This one's a dead hairdresser. Hoopy!"
The next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place
of an advertising account executive; the one after that contained
a second-hand car salesman, third class.
An inspection hatch let into the floor suddenly caught Ford's
attention, and he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at
the clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him.
A thought occurred to Arthur.
"If these are just coffins," he said, "Why are they kept so
cold?"
"Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway," said Ford tugging the
hatchway open. The gas poured down through it. "Why in fact is
anyone going to all the trouble and expense of carting five
thousand dead bodies through space?"
"Ten thousand," said Arthur, pointing at the archway through
which the next chamber was dimly visible.
Ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway. He looked up
again.
"Fifteen thousand," he said, "there's another lot down there."
"Fifteen million," said a voice.
"That's a lot," said Ford, "A lot a lot."
"Turn around slowly," barked the voice, "and put your hands up.
Any other move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits."
"Hello?" said Ford, turning round slowly, putting his hands up
and not making any other move.
"Why," said Arthur Dent, "isn't anyone ever pleased to see us?"
Standing silhouetted in the doorway through which they had
entered the vault was the man who wasn't pleased to see them. His
displeasure was communicated partly by the barking hectoring
quality of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he
waved a long silver Kill-O-Zap gun at them. The designer of the
gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush. "Make
it evil," he'd been told. "Make it totally clear that this gun
has a right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone
standing at the wrong end that things are going badly for them.
If that means sticking all sort of spikes and prongs and
blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a gun for
hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it
is a gun for going out and making people miserable with."
Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily.
The man with the gun moved from the door and circled round them.
As he came into the light they could see his black and gold
uniform on which the buttons were so highly polished that they
shone with an intensity that would have made an approaching
motorist flash his lights in annoyance.
He gestured at the door.
"Out," he said. People who can supply that amount of fire power
don't need to supply verbs as well. Ford and Arthur went out,
closely followed by the wrong end of the Kill-O-Zap gun and the
buttons.
Turning into the corridor they were jostled by twenty-four
oncoming joggers, now showered and changed, who swept on past
them into the vault. Arthur turned to watch them in confusion.
"Move!" screamed their captor.
Arthur moved.
Ford shrugged and moved.
In the vault the joggers went to twenty-four empty sarcophagi
along the side wall, opened them, climbed in, and fell into
twenty-four dreamless sleeps.
"Er, captain ..."
"Yes, Number One?"
"Just heard a sort of report thingy from Number Two."
"Oh, dear."
High up in the bridge of the ship, the Captain stared out into
the infinite reaches of space with mild irritation. From where he
reclined beneath a wide domed bubble he could see before and
above them the vast panorama of stars through which they were
moving - a panorama that had thinned out noticably during the
course of the voyage. Turning and looking backwards, over the
vast two-mile bulk of the ship he could see the far denser mass
of stars behind them which seemed to form almost a solid band.
This was the view through the Galactic centre from which they
were travelling, and indeed had been travelling for years, at a
speed that he couldn't quite remember at the moment, but he knew
it was terribly fast. It was something approaching the speed of
something or other, or was it three times the speed of something
else? Jolly impressive anyway. He peered into the bright distance
behind the ship, looking for something. He did this every few
minutes or so, but never found what he was looking for. He didn't
let it worry him though. The scientist chaps had been very
insistent that everything was going to be perfectly alright
providing nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit
in an orderly fashion.
He wasn't panicking. As far as he was concerned everything was
going splendidly. He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy
sponge. It crept back into his mind that he was feeling mildly
irritated about something. Now what was all that about? A slight
cough alerted him to the fact that the ship's first officer was
still standing nearby.
Nice chap, Number One. Not of the very brightest, had the odd
spot of difficulty doing up his shoe laces, but jolly good
officer material for all that. The Captain wasn't a man to kick a
chap when he was bending over trying to do up his shoe laces,
however long it took him. Not like that ghastly Number Two,
strutting about all over the place, polishing his buttons,
issuing reports every hour: "Ship's still moving, Captain."
"Still on course, Captain." "Oxygen levels still being
maintained, Captain." "Give it a miss," was the Captain's vote.
Ah yes, that was the thing that had been irritating him. He
peered down at Number One.
"Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or other about having
found some prisoners ..."
The Captain thought about this. Seemed pretty unlikely to him,
but he wasn't one to stand in his officers' way.
"Well, perhaps that'll keep him happy for a bit," he said, "He's
always wanted some."
Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent trudged onwards up the ship's
apparently endless corridors. Number Two marched behind them
barking the occasional order about not making any false moves or
trying any funny stuff. They seemed to have passed at least a
mile of continuous brown hessian wall weave. Finally they reached
a large steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at it.
They entered.
To the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most remarkable
thing about the ship's bridge was not the fifty foot diameter
hemispherical dome which covered it, and through which the
dazzling display of stars shone down on them: to people who have
eaten at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, such wonders
are commonplace. Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments
that crowded the long circumferential wall around them. To Arthur
this was exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to
look like, and to Ford it looked thoroughly antiquated: it
confirmed his suspicions that Disaster Area's stuntship had taken
them back at least a million, if not two million, years before
their own time.
No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath.
The bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough hewn blue water
crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside
the Maximegalon Museum of Diseased Imaginings. An intestinal
jumble of plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than
decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave; the taps and
shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump.
As the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly
wrong, and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this
that Number Two approached it.
"Captain, sir!" he shouted through clenched teeth - a difficult
trick but he'd had years during which to perfect it.
A large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above
the rim of the monstrous bath.
"Ah, hello, Number Two," said the Captain, waving a cheery
sponge, "having a nice day?"
Number Two snapped even further to attention than he already was.
"I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven,
sir!" he yapped.
Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion.
"Er ... hello," they said.
The Captain beamed at them. So Number Two had really found some
prisoners. Well, good for him, thought the Captain, nice to see a
chap doing what he's best at.
"Oh, hello there," he said to them, "Excuse me not getting up,
having a quick bath. Well, jynnan tonnyx all round then. Look in
the fridge Number one."
"Certainly sir."
It is a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how
much importance to attach, that something like % of all known
worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have
invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee-N'N-T'N-ix, or
jinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or more variations on
the same phonetic theme. The drinks themselves are not the same,
and vary between the Sivolvian "chinanto mnigs" which is ordinary
water server at slightly above room temperature, and the
Gagrakackan "tzjin-anthony-ks" which kills cows at a hundred
paces; and in fact the one common factor between all of them,
beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they were
all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact
with any other worlds.
What can be made of this fact? It exists in total isolation. As
far as any theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is
right off the graph, and yet it persists. Old structural
linguists get very angry when young structural linguists go on
about it. Young structural linguists get deeply excited about it
and stay up late at night convinced that they are very close to
something of profound importance, and end up becoming old
structural linguists before their time, getting very angry with
the young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and
unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend
too many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs.
Number Two stood before the Captain's bathtub trembling with
frustration.
"Don't you want to interrogate the prisoners sir?" he squealed.
The Captain peered at him in bemusement.
"Why on Golgafrincham should I want to do that?" he asked.
"To get information out of them, sir! To find out why they came
here!"
"Oh no, no, no," said the Captain, "I expect they just dropped in
for a quick jynnan tonnyx, don't you?"
"But sir, they're my prisoners! I must interrogate them!"
The Captain looked at them doubtfully.
"Oh all right," he said, "if you must. Ask them what they want to
drink."
A hard cold gleam came into Number Two's eyes. He advanced slowly
on Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent.
"All right, you scum," he growled, "you vermin ..." He jabbed
Ford with the Kill-O-Zap gun.
"Steady on, Number Two," admonished the Captain gently.
"What do you want to drink!!!" Number Two screamed.
"Well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me," said Ford, "What
about you Arthur?"
Arthur blinked.
"What? Oh, er, yes," he said.
"With ice or without?" bellowed Number Two.
"Oh, with please," said Ford.
"Lemon??!!"
"Yes please," said Ford, "and do you have any of those little
biscuits? You know, the cheesy ones?"
"I'm asking the questions!!!!" howled Number Two, his body
quaking with apoplectic fury.
"Er, Number Two ..." said the Captain softly.
"Sir?!"
"Push off, would you, there's a good chap. I'm trying to have a
relaxing bath."
Number Two's eyes narrowed and became what are known in the
Shouting and Killing People trade as cold slits, the idea
presumably being to give your opponent the impression that you
have lost your glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake.
Why this is frightening is an, as yet, unresolved problem.
He advanced on the captain, his (Number Two's) mouth a thin hard
line. Again, tricky to know why this is understood as fighting
behaviour. If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal, you
were suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast,
you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard
line rather than, as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering
fangs.
"May I remind you sir," hissed Number Two at the Captain, "that
you have now been in that bath for over three years?!" This final
shot delivered, Number Two spun on his heel and stalked off to a
corner to practise darting eye movements in the mirror.
The Captain squirmed in his bath. He gave Ford Prefect a lame
smile.
"Well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine," he said.
Ford slowly lowered his hands. It provoked no reaction. Arthur
lowered his.
Treading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to the bath
pedestal. He patted it.
"Nice," he lied.
He wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully, he
grinned. It was safe.
"Er ..." he said to the Captain.
"Yes?" said the Captain.
"I wonder," said Ford, "could I ask you actually what your job is
in fact?"
A hand tapped him on the shoulder. He span round.
It was the first officer.
"Your drinks," he said.
"Ah, thank you," said Ford. He and Arthur took their jynnan
tonnyx. Arthur sipped his, and was surprised to discover it
tasted very like a whisky and soda.
"I mean, I couldn't help noticing," said Ford, also taking a sip,
"the bodies. In the hold."
"Bodies?" said the Captain in surprise.
Ford paused and thought to himself. Never take anything for
granted, he thought. Could it be that the Captain doesn't know
he's got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship?
The Captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be
playing with a rubber duck.
Ford looked around. Number Two was staring at him in the mirror,
but only for an instant: his eyes were constantly on the move.
The first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray
and smiling benignly.
"Bodies?" said the Captain again.
Ford licked his lips.
"Yes," he said, "All those dead telephone sanitizers and account
executives, you know, down in the hold."
The Captain stared at him. Suddenly he threw back his head and
laughed.
"Oh they're not dead," he said, "Good Lord no, no they're frozen.
They're going to be revived."
Ford did something he very rarely did. He blinked.
Arthur seemed to come out of a trance.
"You mean you've got a hold full of frozen hairdressers?" he
said.
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "Millions of them. Hairdressers,
tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers,
security guards, public relations executives, management
consultants, you name them. We're going to colonize another
planet."
Ford wobbled very slightly.
"Exciting isn't it?" said the Captain.
"What, with that lot?" said Arthur.
"Ah, now don't misunderstand me," said the Captain, "we're just
one of the ships in the Ark Fleet. We're the B' Ark you see.
Sorry, could I just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me?"
Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around
the bath. The Captain let out a sigh of pleasure.
"Thank you so much my dear fellow. Do help yourselves to more
drinks of course."
Ford tossed down his drink, took the bottle from the first
officer's tray and refilled his glass to the top.
"What," he said, "is a B' Ark?"
"This is," said the Captain, and swished the foamy water around
joyfully with the duck.
"Yes," said Ford, "but ..."
"Well what happened you see was," said the Captain, "our planet,
the world from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed."
"Doomed?"
"Oh yes. So what everyone thought was, let's pack the whole
population into some giant spaceships and go and settle on
another planet."
Having told this much of his story, he settled back with a
satisfied grunt.
"You mean a less doomed one?" promoted Arthur.
"What did you say dear fellow?"
"A less doomed planet. You were going to settle on."
"Are going to settle on, yes. So it was decided to build three
ships, you see, three Arks in Space, and ... I'm not boring you
am I?"
"No, no," said Ford firmly, "it's fascinating."
"You know it's delightful," reflected the Captain, "to have
someone else to talk to for a change."
Number Two's eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then
settled back on the mirror, like a pair of flies briefly
distracted from their favourite prey of months old meat.
"Trouble with a long journey like this," continued the Captain,
"is that you end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets
terribly boring because half the time you know what you're going
to say next."
"Only half the time?" asked Arthur in surprise.
The Captain thought for a moment.
"Yes, about half I'd say. Anyway - where's the soap?" He fished
around and found it.
"Yes, so anyway," he resumed, "the idea was that into the first
ship, the A' ship, would go all the brilliant leaders, the
scientists, the great artists, you know, all the achievers; and
into the third, or C' ship, would go all the people who did the
actual work, who made things and did things, and then into the
B' ship - that's us - would go everyone else, the middlemen you
see."
He smiled happily at them.
"And we were sent off first," he concluded, and hummed a little
bathing tune.
The little bathing tune, which had been composed for him by one
of his world's most exciting and prolific jingle writer (who was
currently asleep in hold thirty-six some nine hundred yards
behind them) covered what would otherwise have been an awkward
moment of silence. Ford and Arthur shuffled their feet and
furiously avoided each other's eyes.
"Er ..." said Arthur after a moment, "what exactly was it that
was wrong with your planet then?"
"Oh, it was doomed, as I said," said the Captain, "Apparently it
was going to crash into the sun or something. Or maybe it was
that the moon was going to crash into us. Something of the kind.
Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was."
"Oh," said the first officer suddenly, "I thought it was that the
planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot
piranha bees. Wasn't that it?"
Number Two span around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard light that
only comes with the amount of practise he was prepared to put in.
"That's not what I was told!" he hissed, "My commanding officer
told me that the entire planet was in imminent danger of being
eaten by an enormous mutant star goat!"
"Oh really ..." said Ford Prefect.
"Yes! A monstrous creature from the pit of hell with scything
teeth ten thousand miles long, breath that would boil oceans,
claws that could tear continents from their roots, a thousand
eyes that burned like the sun, slavering jaws a million miles
across, a monster such as you have never ... never ... ever ..."
"And they made sure they sent you lot off first did they?"
inquired Arthur.
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "well everyone said, very nicely I
thought, that it was very important for morale to feel that they
would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a good
haircut and where the phones were clean."
"Oh yes," agreed Ford, "I can see that would be very important.
And the other ships, er ... they followed on after you did they?"
For a moment the Captain did not answer. He twisted round in his
bath and gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards
the bright galactic centre. He squinted into the inconceivable
distance.
"Ah. Well it's funny you should say that," he said and allowed
himself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, "because curiously enough
we haven't heard a peep out of them since we left five years ago
... but they must be behind us somewhere."
He peered off into the distance again.
Ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown.
"Unless of course," he said softly, "they were eaten by the goat
..."
"Ah yes ..." said the Captain with a slight hesitancy creeping
into his voice, "the goat ..." His eyes passed over the solid
shapes of the instruments and computers that lined the bridge.
They winked away innocently at him. He stared out at the stars,
but none of them said a word. He glanced at his first and second
officers, but they seemed lost in their own thoughts for a
moment. He glanced at Ford Prefect who raised his eyebrows at
him.
"It's a funny thing you know," said the Captain at last, "but now
that I actually come to tell the story to someone else ... I mean
does it strike you as odd Number Two?"
"Errrrrrrrrrrr ..." said Number Two.
"Well," said Ford, "I can see that you've got a lot of things
you're going to talk about, so, thanks for the drinks, and if you
could sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet ..."
"Ah, well that's a little difficult you see," said the Captain,
"because our trajectory thingy was preset before we left
Golgafrincham, I think partly because I'm not very good with
figures ..."
"You mean we're stuck here on this ship?" exclaimed Ford suddenly
losing patience with the whole charade, "When are you meant to be
reaching this planet you're meant to be colonizing?"
"Oh, we're nearly there I think," said the Captain, "any second
now. It's probably time I was getting out of this bath in fact.
Oh, I don't know though, why stop just when I'm enjoying it?"
"So we're actually going to land in a minute?"
"Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land as such, no
... er ..."
"What are you talking about?" said Ford sharply.
"Well," said the Captain, picking his way through the words
carefully, "I think as far as I can remember we were programmed
to crash on it."
"Crash?" shouted Ford and Arthur.
"Er, yes," said the Captain, "yes, it's all part of the plan I
think. There was a terribly good reason for it which I can't
quite remember at the moment. It was something to with ... er
..."
Ford exploded.
"You're a load of useless bloody loonies!" he shouted.
"Ah yes, that was it," beamed the Captain, "that was the reason."
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say about the
planet of Golgafrincham: It is a planet with an ancient and
mysterious history, rich in legend, red, and occasionally green
with the blood of those who sought in times gone by to conquer
her; a land of parched and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry
air heady with the scent of the perfumed springs that trickle
over its hot and dusty rocks and nourish the dark and musty
lichens beneath; a land of fevered brows and intoxicated
imaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the lichens; a
land also of cool and shaded thoughts amongst those who have
learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath; a
land also of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and
of the spirit. This was its history.
And in all this ancient and mysterious history, the most
mysterious figures of all were without doubt those of the Great
Circling Poets of Arium. These Circling Poets used to live in
remote mountain passes where they would lie in wait for small
bands of unwary travellers, circle round them, and throw rocks at
them.
And when the travellers cried out, saying why didn't they go away
and get on with writing some poems instead of pestering people
with all this rock-throwing business, they would suddenly stop,
and then break into one of the seven hundred and ninety-four
great Song Cycles of Vassilian. These songs were all of
extraordinary beauty, and even more extraordinary length, and all
fell into exactly the same pattern.
The first part of each song would tell how there once went forth
from the City of Vassilian a party of five sage princes with four
horses. The princes, who are of course brave, noble and wise,
travel widely in distant lands, fought giant ogres, pursue exotic
philosophies, take tea with weird gods and rescue beautiful
monsters from ravening princesses before finally announcing that
they have achieved enlightenment and that their wanderings are
therefore accomplished.
The second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of
all their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to
walk back.
All this lay in the planet's remote past. It was, however, a
descendant of one of these eccentric poets who invented the
spurious tales of impending doom which enabled the people of
Golgafrincham to rid themselves of an entire useless third of
their population. The other two-thirds stayed firmly at home and
lived full, rich and happy lives until they were all suddenly
wiped out by a virulent disease contracted from a dirty
telephone.
That night the ship crash-landed on to an utterly insignificant
little green-blue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow
sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the
Western spiral arm of the Galaxy.
In the hours preceding the crash Ford Prefect had fought
furiously but in vain to unlock the controls of the ship from
their pre-ordained flight path. It had quickly become apparent to
him that the ship had been programmed to convey its payload
safely, in uncomfortably, to its new home but to cripple itself
beyond repair in the process.
Its screaming, blazing descent through the atmosphere had
stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and
its final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp had left its
crew only a few hours of darkness during which to revive and
offload its deep-frozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began to
settle almost at once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the
stagnant slime. Once or twice during the night it was starkly
silhouetted against the sky as burning meteors - the detritus of
its descent - flashed across the sky.
In the grey pre-dawn light it let out an obscene roaring gurgle
and sank for ever into the stinking depths.
When the sun came up that morning it shed its thin watery light
over a vast area heaving with wailing hairdressers, public
relations executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing
their way desperately to dry land.
A less strong minded sun would probably have gone straight back
down again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky and
after a while the influence of its warming rays began to have
some restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures.
Countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp in
the night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship,
but those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands and
as the day wore on they crawled out over the surrounding
countryside, each looking for a few square feet of solid ground
on which to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal.
Two figures moved further afield.
From a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent watched the
horror of which they could not feel a part.
"Filthy dirty trick to pull," muttered Arthur.
Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged.
"An imaginative solution to a problem I'd have thought," he said.
"Why can't people just learn to live together in peace and
harmony?" said Arthur.
Ford gave a loud, very hollow laugh.
"Forty-two!" he said with a malicious grin, "No, doesn't work.
Never mind."
Arthur looked at him as if he'd gone mad and, seeing nothing to
indicate the contrary, realized that it would be perfectly
reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened.
"What do you think will happen to them all?" he said after a
while.
"In an infinite Universe anything can happen," said Ford, "Even
survival. Strange but true."
A curious look came into his eyes as they passed over the
landscape and then settles again on the scene of misery below
them.
"I think they'll manage for a while," he said.
Arthur looked up sharply.
"Why do you say that?" he said.
Ford shrugged.
"Just a hunch," he said, and refused to be drawn to any further
questions.
"Look," he said suddenly.
Arthur followed his pointing finger. Down amongst the sprawling
masses a figure was moving - or perhaps lurching would be a more
accurate description. He appeared to be carrying something on his
shoulder. As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he
seemed to wave whatever the something was at them in a drunken
fashion. After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a
heap.
Arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him.
"Movie camera," said Ford. "Recording the historic movement."
"Well, I don't know about you," said Ford again after a moment,
"but I'm off."
He sat a while in silence.
After a while this seemed to require comment.
"Er, when you say you're off, what do you mean exactly?" said
Arthur.
"Good question," said Ford, "I'm getting total silence."
Looking over his shoulder Arthur saw that he was twiddling with
knobs on a small box. Ford had already introduced this box as a
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently and
not pursued the matter. In his mind the Universe still divided
into two parts - the Earth, and everything else. The Earth having
been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass meant
that this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended
to cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact
with his home. Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matics belonged firmly in the
"everything else" category.
"Not a sausage," said Ford, shaking the thing.
Sausage, thought Arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at the
primitive world about him, what I wouldn't give for a good Earth
sausage.
"Would you believe," said Ford in exasperation, "that there are
no transmissions of any kind within light years of this benighted
tip? Are you listening to me?"
"What?" said Arthur.
"We're in trouble," said Ford.
"Oh," said Arthur. This sounded like month-old news to him.
"Until we pick up anything on this machine," said Ford, "our
chances of getting off this planet are zero. It may be some freak
standing wave effect in the planet's magnetic field - in which
case we just travel round and round till we find a clear
reception area. Coming?"
He picked up his gear and strode off.
Arthur looked down the hill. The man with the movie camera had
struggled back up to his feet just in time to film one of his
colleagues collapsing.
Arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after Ford.
"I trust you had a pleasant meal?" said Zarniwoop to Zaphod and
Trillian as they rematerialized on the bridge of the starship
Heart of Gold and lay panting on the floor.
Zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him.
"You," he spat. He staggered to his feet and stomped off to find
a chair to slump into. He found one and slumped into it.
"I have programmed the computer with the Improbability
Coordinates pertinent to our journey," said Zarniwoop, "we will
arrive there very shortly. Meanwhile, why don't you relax and
prepare yourself for the meeting?"
Zaphod said nothing. He got up again and marched over to a small
cabinet from which he pulled a bottle of old Janx spirit. He took
a long pull at it.
"And when this is all done," said Zaphod savagely, "it's done,
alright? I'm free to go and do what the hell I like and lie on
beaches and stuff?"
"It depends what transpires from the meeting," said Zarniwoop.
"Zaphod, who is this man?" said Trillian shakily, wobbling to her
feet, "What's he doing here? Why's he on our ship?"
"He's a very stupid man," said Zaphod, "who wants to meet the man
who rules the Universe."
"Ah," said Trillian taking the bottle from Zaphod and helping
herself, "a social climber."
The major problem - one of the major problems, for there are
several - one of the many major problems with governing people is
that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get
people to let them do it to them.
To summarize: it is a well known fact, that those people who most
want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting
themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do
the job. To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a
problem.
And so this is the situation we find: a succession of Galactic
Presidents who so much enjoy the fun and palaver of being in
power that they very rarely notice that they're not.
And somewhere in the shadows behind them - who?
Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed
to?
On a small obscure world somewhere in the middle of nowhere in
particular - nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it
is protected by a vast field of unprobability to which only six
men in this galaxy have a key - it was raining.
It was bucketing down, and had been for hours. It beat the top of
the sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped
a stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath.
The rain pelted and danced on the corrugated iron roof of the
small shack that stood in the middle of this patch of scrubby
land. It obliterated the small rough pathway that led from the
shack down to the seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of
interesting shells which had been placed there.
The noise of the rain on the roof of the shack was deafening
within, but went largely unnoticed by its occupant, whose
attention was otherwise engaged.
He was a tall shambling man with rough straw-coloured hair that
was damp from the leaking roof. His clothes were shabby, his back
was hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed.
In his shack was an old beaten-up armchair, an old scratched
table, an old mattress, some cushions and a stove that was small
but warm.
There was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten cat, and this
was currently the focus of the man's attention. He bent his
shambling form over it.
"Pussy, pussy, pussy," he said, "coochicoochicoochicoo ... pussy
want his fish? Nice piece of fish ... pussy want it?"
The cat seemed undecided on the matter. It pawed rather
condescendingly at the piece of fish the man was holding out, and
then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor.
"Pussy not eat his fish, pussy get thin and waste away, I think,"
said the man. Doubt crept into his voice.
"I imagine this is what will happen," he said, "but how can I
tell?"
He proffered the fish again.
"Pussy think," he said, "eat fish or not eat fish. I think it is
better if I don't get involved." He sighed.
"I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who
am I to judge?"
He left the fish on the floor for the cat, and retired to his
seat.
"Ah, I seem to see you eating it," he said at last, as the cat
exhausted the entertainment possibilities of the speck of dust
and pounced on to the fish.
"I like it when I see you eat the fish," said the man, "because
in my mind you will waste away if you don't."
He picked up from the table a piece of paper and the stub of a
pencil. He held one in one hand and the other in the other, and
experimented with the different ways of bringing them together.
He tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper,
then next to the paper. He tried wrapping the paper round the
pencil, he tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the
paper and then he tried rubbing the sharp end of the pencil
against the paper. It made a mark, and he was delighted with the
discovery, as he was every day. He picked up another piece of
paper from the table. This had a crossword on it. He studied it
briefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest.
He tried sitting on one of his hands and was intrigued by the
feel of the bones of his hip.
"Fish come from far away," he said, "or so I'm told. Or so I
imagine I'm told. When the men come, or when in my mind the men
come in their six black ships, do they come in your mind too?
What do you see pussy?"
He looked at the cat, which was more concerned with getting the
fish down as rapidly as possible than it was with these
speculations.
"And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions? What do
their voices mean to you? Perhaps you just think they're singing
songs to you." He reflected on this, and saw the flaw in the
supposition.
"Perhaps they are singing songs to you," he said, "and I just
think they're asking me questions."
He paused again. Sometimes he would pause for days, just to see
what it was like.
"Do you think they came today?" he said, "I do. There's mud on
the floor, cigarettes and whisky on the table, fish on a plate
for you and a memory of them in my mind. Hardly conclusive
evidence I know, but then all evidence is circumstantial. And
look what else they've left me."
He reached over to the table and pulled some things off it.
"Crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator."
He played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to
sleep and the rain outside continued to pour. Eventually he put
the calculator aside.
"I think I must be right in thinking they ask me questions," he
said, "To come all that way and leave all these things for the
privilege of singing songs to you would be very strange
behaviour. Or so it seems to me. Who can tell, who can tell."
From the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with a spill
from the stove. He inhaled deeply and sat back.
"I think I saw another ship in the sky today," he said at last.
"A big white one. I've never seen a big white one, just the six
black ones. And the six green ones. And the others who say they
come from so far away. Never a big white one. Perhaps six small
black ones can look like one big white one at certain times.
Perhaps I would like a glass of whisky. Yes, that seems more
likely."
He stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by the
mattress. He poured in a measure from his whisky bottle. He sat
again.
"Perhaps some other people are coming to see me," he said.
A hundred yards away, pelted by the torrential rain, lay the
Heart of Gold.
Its hatchway opened, and three figures emerged, huddling into
themselves to keep the rain off their faces.
"In there?" shouted Trillian above the noise of the rain.
"Yes," said Zarniwoop.
"That shack?"
"Yes."
"Weird," said Zaphod.
"But it's in the middle of nowhere," said Trillian, "we must have
come to the wrong place. You can't rule the Universe from a
shack."
They hurried through the pouring rain, and arrived, wet through,
at the door. They knocked. They shivered.
The door opened.
"Hello?" said the man.
"Ah, excuse me," said Zarniwoop, "I have reason to believe ..."
"Do you rule the Universe?" said Zaphod.
The man smiled at him.
"I try not to," he said, "Are you wet?"
Zaphod looked at him in astonishment.
"Wet?" he cried, "Doesn't it look as if we're wet?"
"That's how it looks to me," said the man, "but how you feel
about it might be an altogether different matter. If you feel
warmth makes you dry, you'd better come in."
They went in.
They looked around the tiny shack, Zarniwoop with slight
distaste, Trillian with interest, Zaphod with delight.
"Hey, er ..." said Zaphod, "what's your name?"
The man looked at them doubtfully.
"I don't know. Why, do you think I should have one? It seems very
odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name."
He invited Trillian to sit in the chair. He sat on the edge of
the chair, Zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table and Zaphod
lay on the mattress.
"Wowee!" said Zaphod, "the seat of power!" He tickled the cat.
"Listen," said Zarniwoop, "I must ask you some questions."
"Alright," said the man kindly, "you can sing to my cat if you
like."
"Would he like that?" asked Zaphod.
"You'd better ask him," said the man.
"Does he talk?" said Zaphod.
"I have no memory of him talking," said the man, "but I am very
unreliable."
Zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket.
"Now," he said, "you do rule the Universe, do you?"
"How can I tell?" said the man.
Zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper.
"How long have you been doing this?"
"Ah," said the man, "this is a question about the past is it?"
Zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement. This wasn't exactly what
he had been expecting.
"Yes," he said.
"How can I tell," said the man, "that the past isn't a fiction
designed to account for the discrepancy between my immediate
physical sensations and my state of mind?"
Zarniwoop stared at him. The steam began to rise from his sodden
clothes.
"So you answer all questions like this?" he said.
The man answered quickly.
"I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say
things. More I cannot say."
Zaphod laughed happily.
"I'll drink to that," he said and pulled out the bottle of Janx
spirit. He leaped up and handed the bottle to the ruler of the
Universe, who took it with pleasure.
"Good on you, great ruler," he said, "tell it like it is."
"No, listen to me," said Zarniwoop, "people come to you do they?
In ships ..."
"I think so," said the man. He handed the bottle to Trillian.
"And they ask you," said Zarniwoop, "to take decisions for them?
About people's lives, about worlds, about economies, about wars,
about everything going on out there in the Universe?"
"Out there?" said the man, "out where?"
"Out there!" said Zarniwoop pointing at the door.
"How can you tell there's anything out there," said the man
politely, "the door's closed."
The rain continued to pound the roof. Inside the shack it was
warm.
"But you know there's a whole Universe out there!" cried
Zarniwoop. "You can't dodge your responsibilities by saying they
don't exist!"
The ruler of the Universe thought for a long while whilst
Zarniwoop quivered with anger.
"You're very sure of your facts," he said at last, "I couldn't
trust the thinking of a man who takes the Universe - if there is
one - for granted."
Zarniwoop still quivered, but was silent.
"I only decide about my Universe," continued the man quietly. "My
Universe is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay."
"But don't you believe in anything?"
The man shrugged and picked up his cat.
"I don't understand what you mean," he said.
"You don't understand that what you decide in this shack of yours
affects the lives and fates of millions of people? This is all
monstrously wrong!"
"I don't know. I've never met all these people you speak of. And
neither, I suspect, have you. They only exist in words we hear.
It is folly to say you know what is happening to other people.
Only they know, if they exist. They have their own Universes of
their own eyes and ears."
Trillian said:
"I think I'm just popping outside for a moment."
She left and walked into the rain.
"Do you believe other people exist?" insisted Zarniwoop.
"I have no opinion. How can I say?"
"I'd better see what's up with Trillian," said Zaphod and slipped
out.
Outside, he said to her:
"I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?"
"Very good," said Trillian. They walked off into the rain.
Inside, Zarniwoop continued.
"But don't you understand that people live or die on your word?"
The ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he
heard the faint sound of the ship's engines starting he spoke to
cover it.
"It's nothing to do with me," he said, "I am not involved with
people. The Lord knows I am not a cruel man."
"Ah!" barked Zarniwoop, "you say The Lord'. You believe in
something!"
"My cat," said the man benignly, picking it up and stroking it,
"I call him The Lord. I am kind to him."
"Alright," said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, "How do you
know he exists? How do you know he knows you to be kind, or
enjoys what he thinks of as your kindness?"
"I don't," said the man with a smile, "I have no idea. It merely
pleases me to behave in a certain way to what appears to be a
cat. Do you behave any differently? Please, I think I am tired."
Zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about.
"Where are the other two?" he said suddenly.
"What other two?" said the ruler of the Universe, settling back
into his chair and refilling his whisky glass.
"Beeblebrox and the girl! The two who were here!"
"I remember no one. The past is a fiction to account for ..."
"Stuff it," snapped Zarniwoop and ran out into the rain. There
was no ship. The rain continued to churn the mud. There was no
sign to show where the ship had been. He hollered into the rain.
He turned and ran back to the shack and found it locked.
The ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in his chair. After a
while he played with the pencil and the paper again and was
delighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the one on
the other. Various noises continued outside, but he didn't know
whether they were real or not. He then talked to his table for a
week to see how it would react.
The stars came out that night, dazzling in their brilliance and
clarity. Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any
means of judging and finally stopped to rest. The night was cool
and balmy, the air pure, the Sub-Etha Sens.O.Matic totally
silent.
A wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical calm which
combined with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter
of insects and the brilliant light of the stars to soothe their
jangled spirits. Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than
he could count on a long afternoon, was moved to wonder if this
was the most beautiful he had ever seen. All that day they had
passed through rolling green hills and valleys, richly covered
with grasses, wild scented flowers and tall thickly leaved trees,
the sun had warmed them, light breezes had kept them cool, and
Ford Prefect had checked his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic at less and
less frequent intervals, and had exhibited less and less
annoyance at its continued silence. He was beginning to think he
liked it here.
Cool though the night air was they slept soundly and comfortably
in the open and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall
feeling refreshed but hungry. Ford had stuffed some small rolls
into his satchel at Milliways and they breakfasted off those
before moving on.
So far they had wandered purely at random, but now they struck
out firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore
this world they should have some clear idea of where they had
come from and where they were going.
Shortly before noon they had their first indication that the
world they had landed on was not an uninhabited one: a half
glimpsed face amongst the trees, watching them. It vanished at
the moment they both saw it, but the image they were both left
with was of a humanoid creature, curious to see them but not
alarmed. Half an hour later they glimpsed another such face, and
ten minutes after that another.
A minute later they stumbled into a wide clearing and stopped
short.
Before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of about
two dozen men and women. They stood still and quiet facing Ford
and Arthur. Around some of the women huddled some small children
and behind the group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings
made of mud and branches.
Ford and Arthur held their breath.
The tallest of the men stood a little over five feet high, they
all stooped forward slightly, had longish arms and lowish
foreheads, and clear bright eyes with which they stared intently
at the strangers.
Seeing that they carried no weapons and made no move towards
them, Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly.
For a while the two groups simply stared at each other, neither
side making any move. The natives seemed puzzled by the
intruders, and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were
quite clearly not issuing any invitations.
For a full two minutes nothing continued to happen.
After two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened.
"Hello," he said.
The women drew their children slightly closer to them.
The men made hardly any discernible move and yet their whole
disposition made it clear that the greeting was not welcome - it
was not resented in any great degree, it was just not welcome.
One of the men, who had been standing slightly forward of the
rest of the group and who might therefore have been their leader,
stepped forward. His face was quiet and calm, almost serene.
"Ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh," he said quietly.
This caught Arthur by surprise. He had grown so used to receiving
an instantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he
heard via the Babel Fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to
be aware of it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by
the fact that it didn't seem to be working. Vague shadows of
meaning had flickered at the back of his mind, but there was
nothing he could get any firm grasp on. He guessed, correctly as
it happens, that these people had as yet evolved no more than the
barest rudiments of language, and that the Babel Fish was
therefore powerless to help. He glanced at Ford, who was
infinitely more experienced in these matters.
"I think," said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, "he's asking
us if we'd mind walking on round the edge of the village."
A moment later, a gesture from the man-creature seemed to confirm
this.
"Ruurgggghhhh urrgggh; urgh urgh (uh ruh) rruurruuh ug,"
continued the man-creature.
"The general gist," said Ford, "as far as I can make out, is that
we are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if
we would walk round his village rather than through it it would
make them all very happy."
"So what do we do?"
"I think we make them happy," said Ford.
Slowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the
clearing. This seemed to go down very well with the natives who
bowed to them very slightly and then went about their business.
Ford and Arthur continued their journey through the wood. A few
hundred yards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small
pile of fruit lying in their path - berries that looked
remarkably like raspberries and blackberries, and pulpy, green
skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears.
So far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had
seen, though the trees and bushed were laden with them.
"Look at it this way," Ford Prefect had said, "fruit and berries
on strange planets either make you live or make you die.
Therefore the point at which to start toying with them is when
you're going to die if you don't. That way you stay ahead. The
secret of healthy hitch-hiking is to eat junk food."
They looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion. It
looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger.
"Look at it this way," said Ford, "er ..."
"Yes?" said Arthur.
"I'm trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get
to eat it," said Ford.
The leaf-dappled sun gleamed on the pulp skins of the things
which looked like pears. The things which looked like raspberries
and strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur had ever
seen, even in ice cream commercials.
"Why don't we eat them and think about it afterwards?" he said.
"Maybe that's what they want us to do."
"Alright, look at it this way ..."
"Sounds good so far."
"It's there for us to eat. Either it's good or it's bad, either
they want to feed us or to poison us. If it's poisonous and we
don't eat it they'll just attack us some other way. If we don't
eat, we lose out either way."
"I like the way you're thinking," said Ford, "Now eat one."
Hesitantly, Arthur picked up one of those things that looked like
pears.
"I always thought that about the Garden of Eden story," said
Ford.
"Eh?"
"Garden of Eden. Tree. Apple. That bit, remember?"
"Yes of course I do."
"Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and
says do what you like guys, oh, but don't eat the apple. Surprise
surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush
shouting Gotcha'. It wouldn't have made any difference if they
hadn't eaten it."
"Why not?"
"Because if you're dealing with somebody who has the sort of
mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks
under them you know perfectly well they won't give up. They'll
get you in the end."
"What are you talking about?"
"Never mind, eat the fruit."
"You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden."
"Eat the fruit."
"Sounds quite like it too."
Arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear.
"It's a pear," he said.
A few moments later, when they had eaten the lot, Ford Prefect
turned round and called out.
"Thank you. Thank you very much," he called, "you're very kind."
They went on their way.
For the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they kept on
finding the occasional gift of fruit lying in their path, and
though they once or twice had a quick glimpse of a native man-
creature amongst the trees, they never again made direct contact.
They decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear
that they were grateful simply to be left alone.
The fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was
where the sea started.
Having no pressing calls on their time they built a raft and
crossed the sea. It was reasonably calm, only about sixty miles
wide and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing, landing in a
country that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left.
Life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a while at least
they were able to cope with the problems of aimlessness and
isolation by deciding to ignore them. When the craving for
company became too great they would know where to find it, but
for the moment they were happy to feel that the Golgafrinchans
were hundreds of miles behind them.
Nevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic
more often again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was
so faint and from such enormous distance that it depressed him
more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken.
On a whim they turned northwards. After weeks of travelling they
came to another sea, built another raft and crossed it. This time
it was harder going, the climate was getting colder. Arthur
suspected a streak of masochism in Ford Prefect - the increasing
difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense of purpose
that was otherwise lacking. He strode onwards relentlessly.
Their journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous
terrain of breathtaking sweep and beauty. The vast, jagged, snow
covered peaks ravished their senses. The cold began to bite into
their bones.
They wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs which Ford
Prefect acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of
ex-Pralite monks running a Mind-Surfing resort in the Hills of
Hunian.
The galaxy is littered with ex-Pralite monks, all on the make,
because the mental control techniques the Order have evolved as a
form of devotional discipline are, frankly, sensational - and
extraordinary numbers of monks leave the Order just after they
have finished their devotional training and just before they take
their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest
of their lives.
Ford's technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a
while and smiling.
After a while an animal - a deer perhaps - would appear from out
of the trees and watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to
smile at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he would seem
to radiate a deep and universal love, a love which reached out to
embrace all of creation. A wonderful quietness would descend on
the surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from
this transfigured man. Slowly the deer would approach, step by
step, until it was almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect
would reach out to it and break its neck.
"Pheromone control," he said it was, "you just have to know how
to generate the right smell."
A few days after landing in this mountainous land they hit a
coastline which swept diagonally before them from the south-west
to the north-east, a coastline of monumental grandeur: deep
majestic ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice - fjords.
For two further days they scrambled and climbed over the rocks
and glaciers, awe-struck with beauty.
"Arthur!" yelled Ford suddenly.
It was the afternoon of the second day. Arthur was sitting on a
high rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the
craggy promontories.
"Arthur!" yelled Ford again.
Arthur looked to where Ford's voice had come from, carried
faintly in the wind.
Ford had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur found him there
crouching by the solid wall of blue ice. He was tense with
excitement - his eyes darted up to meet Arthur's.
"Look," he said, "look!"
Arthur looked. He saw the solid wall of blue ice.
"Yes," he said, "it's a glacier. I've already seen it."
"No," said Ford, "you've looked at it, you haven't seen it.
Look!"
Ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice.
Arthur peered - he saw nothing but vague shadows.
"Move back from it," insisted Ford, "look again."
Arthur moved back and looked again.
"No," he said, and shrugged. "What am I supposed to be looking
for?"
And suddenly he saw it.
"You see it?"
He saw it.
His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it hadn't got
anything to say yet and shut it again. His brain then started to
contend with the problem of what his eyes told it they were
looking at, but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth
which promptly fell open again. Once more gathering up the jaw,
his brain lost control of his left hand which then wandered
around in an aimless fashion. For a second or so the brain tried
to catch the left hand without letting go of the mouth and
simultaneously tried to think about what was buried in the ice,
which is probably why the legs went and Arthur dropped restfully
to the ground.
The thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a
network of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the
surface. Looked at it from the right angle they resolved into the
solid shapes of letters from an alien alphabet, each about three
feet high; and for those, like Arthur, who couldn't read
Magrathean there was above the letters the outline of a face
hanging in the ice.
It was an old face, thin and distinguished, careworn but not
unkind.
It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the
coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on.
A thin whine filled the air. It whirled and howled through the
trees upsetting the squirrels. A few birds flew off in disgust.
The noise danced and skittered round the clearing. It whooped, it
rasped, it generally offended.
The Captain, however, regarded the lone bagpiper with an
indulgent eye. Little could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once
he had got over the loss of his gorgeous bath during that
unpleasantness in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to
find his new life remarkably congenial. A hollow had been scooped
out of a large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing,
and in this he would bask daily whilst attendants sloshed water
over him. Not particularly warm water, it must be said, as they
hadn't yet worked out a way of heating it. Never mind, that would
come, and in the meantime search parties were scouring the
countryside far and wide for a hot spring, preferably one in a
nice leafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine - perfection. To
those who said that they had a feeling soap wasn't found in
mines, the Captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was
because no one had looked hard enough, and this possibility had
been reluctantly acknowledged.
No, life was very pleasant, and the greatest thing about it was
that when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en
suite, and when in the fullness of time the cry came
reverberating across the hills that the soap mine had been
located and was producing five hundred cakes a day it would be
more pleasant still. It was very important to have things to look
forward to.
Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the bagpipes,
increasing the Captain's already considerable pleasure at the
thought that any moment now they might stop. That was something
he looked forward to as well.
What else was pleasant, he asked himself? Well, so many things:
the red and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching;
the peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a
couple of hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing
art director and his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off the six
shiny telephones lined up along the edge of his rock-hewn bath.
The only thing nicer than a phone that didn't ring all the time
(or indeed at all) was six phones that didn't ring all the time
(or indeed at all).
Nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people
slowly assembling in the clearing around him to watch the
afternoon committee meeting.
The Captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak. The
afternoon committee meetings were his favourite.
Other eyes watched the assembling crowds. High in a tree on the
edge of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from
foreign climes. After his six month journey he was lean and
healthy, his eyes gleamed, he wore a reindeer-skin coat; his
beard was as thick and his face as bronzed as a country-rock
singer's.
He and Arthur Dent had been watching the Golgafrinchans for
almost a week now, and Ford had decided to stir things up a bit.
The clearing was now full. Hundreds of men and women lounged
around, chatting, eating fruit, playing cards and generally
having a fairly relaxed time of it. Their track suits were now
all dirty and even torn, but they all had immaculately styled
hair. Ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their
track suits full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be
some form of insulation against the coming winter. Ford's eyes
narrowed. They couldn't be interested in botany of a sudden could
they?
In the middle of these speculations the Captain's voice rose
above the hubbub.
"Alright," he said, "I'd like to call this meeting to some sort
of order if that's at all possible. Is that alright with
everybody?" He smiled genially. "In a minute. When you're all
ready."
The talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent,
except for the bagpiper who seemed to be in some wild and
uninhabitable musical world of his own. A few of those in his
immediate vicinity threw some leaves to him. If there was any
reason for this then it escaped Ford Prefect for the moment.
A small group of people had clustered round the Captain and one
of them was clearly beginning to speak. He did this by standing
up, clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance as
if to signify to the crowd that he would be with them in a
minute.
The crowd of course were riveted and all turned their eyes on
him.
A moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be the right
dramatic moment to make his entry. The man turned to speak.
Ford dropped down out of the tree.
"Hi there," he said.
The crowd swivelled round.
"Ah my dear fellow," called out the Captain, "Got any matches on
you? Or a lighter? Anything like that?"
"No," said Ford, sounding a little deflated. It wasn't what he'd
prepared. He decided he'd better be a little stronger on the
subject.
"No I haven't," he continued, "No matches. Instead I bring you
news ..."
"Pity," said the Captain, "We've all run out you see. Haven't had
a hot bath in weeks."
Ford refused to be headed off.
"I bring you news," he said, "of a discovery that might interest
you."
"Is it on the agenda?" snapped the man whom Ford had interrupted.
Ford smiled a broad country-rock singer smile.
"Now, come on," he said.
"Well I'm sorry," said the man huffily, "but speaking as a
management consultant of many years' standing, I must insist on
the importance of observing the committee structure."
Ford looked round the crowd.
"He's mad you know," he said, "this is a prehistoric planet."
"Address the chair!" snapped the management consultant.
"There isn't chair," explained Ford, "there's only a rock."
The management consultant decided that testiness was what the
situation now called for.
"Well, call it a chair," he said testily.
"Why not call it a rock?" asked Ford.
"You obviously have no conception," said the management
consultant, not abandoning testiness in favour of good old
fashioned hauteur, "of modern business methods."
"And you have no conception of where you are," said Ford.
A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it.
"Shut up, you two," she said, "I want to table a motion."
"You mean boulder a motion," tittered a hairdresser.
"Order, order!" yapped the management consultant.
"Alright," said Ford, "let's see how you are doing." He plonked
himself down on the ground to see how long he could keep his
temper.
The Captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise.
"I would like to call to order," he said pleasantly, "the five
hundred and seventy-third meeting of the colonization committee
of Fintlewoodlewix ..."
Ten seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again.
"This is futile," he exclaimed, "five hundred and seventy-three
committee meetings and you haven't even discovered fire yet!"
"If you would care," said the girl with the strident voice, "to
examine the agenda sheet ..."
"Agenda rock," trilled the hairdresser happily.
"Thank you, I've made that point," muttered Ford.
"... you ... will ... see ..." continued the girl firmly, "that
we are having a report from the hairdressers' Fire Development
Sub-Committee today."
"Oh ... ah -" said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which is
recognized the whole Galaxy over as meaning "Er, will next
Tuesday do?"
"Alright," said Ford, rounding on him, "what have you done? What
are you going to do? What are your thoughts on fire development?"
"Well I don't know," said the hairdresser, "All they gave me was
a couple of sticks ..."
"So what have you done with them?"
Nervously, the hairdresser fished in his track suit top and
handed over the fruits of his labour to Ford.
Ford held them up for all to see.
"Curling tongs," he said.
The crowd applauded.
"Never mind," said Ford, "Rome wasn't burnt in a day."
The crowd hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about, but
they loved it nevertheless. They applauded.
"Well, you're obviously being totally naive of course," said the
girl, "When you've been in marketing as long as I have you'll
know that before any new product can be developed it has to be
properly researched. We've got to find out what people want from
fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them."
The crowd were tense. They were expecting something wonderful
from Ford.
"Stick it up your nose," he said.
"Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know," insisted
the girl, "Do people want fire that can be applied nasally?"
"Do you?" Ford asked the crowd.
"Yes!" shouted some.
"No!" shouted others happily.
They didn't know, they just thought it was great.
"And the wheel," said the Captain, "What about this wheel thingy?
It sounds a terribly interesting project."
"Ah," said the marketing girl, "Well, we're having a little
difficulty there."
"Difficulty?" exclaimed Ford, "Difficulty? What do you mean,
difficulty? It's the single simplest machine in the entire
Universe!"
The marketing girl soured him with a look.
"Alright, Mr Wiseguy," she said, "you're so clever, you tell us
what colour it should have."
The crowd went wild. One up to the home team, they thought. Ford
shrugged his shoulders and sat down again.
"Almighty Zarquon," he said, "have none of you done anything?"
As if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of
noise from the entrance to the clearing. The crowd couldn't
believe the amount of entertainment they were getting this
afternoon: in marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the
remnants of their Golgafrincham rd Regiment dress uniforms.
About half of them still carried Kill-O-Zap guns, the rest now
carried spears which they struck together as they marched. They
looked bronzed, healthy, and utterly exhausted and bedraggled.
They clattered to a halt and banged to attention. One of them
fell over and never moved again.
"Captain, sir!" cried Number Two - for he was their leader -
"Permission to report sir!"
"Yes, alright Number Two, welcome back and all that. Find any hot
springs?" said the Captain despondently.
"No sir!"
"Thought you wouldn't."
Number Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the
bath.
"We have discovered another continent!"
"When was this?"
"It lies across the sea ..." said Number Two, narrowing his eyes
significantly, "to the east!"
"Ah."
Number Two turned to face the crowd. He raised his gun above his
head. This is going to be great, thought the crowd.
"We have declared war on it!"
Wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the clearing
- this was beyond all expectation.
"Wait a minute," shouted Ford Prefect, "wait a minute!"
He leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while he got
it, or at least the best silence he could hope for under the
circumstances: the circumstances were that the bagpiper was
spontaneously composing a national anthem.
"Do we have to have the piper?" demanded Ford.
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "we've given him a grant."
Ford considered opening this idea up for debate but quickly
decided that that way madness lay. Instead he slung a well judged
rock at the piper and turned to face Number Two.
"War?" he said.
"Yes!" Number Two gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect.
"On the next continent?"
"Yes! Total warfare! The war to end all wars!"
"But there's no one even living there yet!"
Ah, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point.
Number Two's gaze hovered undisturbed. In this respect his eyes
were like a couple of mosquitos that hover purposefully three
inches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes,
fly swats or rolled newspapers.
"I know that," he said, "but there will be one day! So we have
left an open-ended ultimatum."
"What?"
"And blown up a few military installations."
The Captain leaned forward out of his bath.
"Military installations Number Two?" he said.
For a moment the eyes wavered.
"Yes sir, well potential military installations. Alright ...
trees."
The moment of uncertainty passed - his eyes flickered like whips
over his audience.
"And," he roared, "we interrogated a gazelle!"
He flipped his Kill-O-Zap gun smartly under his arm and marched
off through the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the
ecstatic crowd. A few steps was all he managed before he was
caught up and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the
clearing.
Ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together.
"So what else have you done?" he inquired after the celebrations
had died down.
"We have started a culture," said the marketing girl.
"Oh yes?" said Ford.
"Yes. One of our film producers is already making a fascinating
documentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area."
"They're not cavemen."
"They look like cavemen."
"Do they live in caves?"
"Well ..."
"They live in huts."
"Perhaps they're having their caves redecorated," called out a
wag from the crowd.
Ford rounded on him angrily.
"Very funny," he said, "but have you noticed that they're dying
out?"
On their journey back, Ford and Arthur had come across two
derelict villages and the bodies of many natives in the woods,
where they had crept away to die. Those that still lived were
stricken and listless, as if they were suffering some disease of
the spirit rather than the body. They moved sluggishly and with
an infinite sadness. Their future had been taken away from them.
"Dying out!" repeated Ford. "Do you know what that means?"
"Er ... we shouldn't sell them any life insurance?" called out
the wag again.
Ford ignored him, and appealed to the whole crowd.
"Can you try and understand," he said, "that it's just since
we've arrived that they've started dying out!"
"In fact that comes over terribly well in this film," said the
marketing girl, "and just gives it that poignant twist which is
the hallmark of the really great documentary. The producer's very
committed."
"He should be," muttered Ford.
"I gather," said the girl, turning to address the Captain who was
beginning to nod off, "that he wants to make one about you next,
Captain."
"Oh really?" he said, coming to with a start, "that's awfully
nice."
"He's got a very strong angle on it, you know, the burden of
responsibility, the loneliness of command ..."
The Captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment.
"Well, I wouldn't overstress that angle, you know," he said
finally, "one's never alone with a rubber duck."
He held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from the
crowd.
All the while, the Management Consultant had been sitting in
stony silence, his finger tips pressed to his temples to indicate
that he was waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary.
At this point he decided he would not wait all day after all, he
would merely pretend that the last half hour hadn't happened.
He rose to his feet.
"If," he said tersely, "we could for a moment move on to the
subject of fiscal policy ..."
"Fiscal policy!" whooped Ford Prefect, "Fiscal policy!"
The Management Consultant gave him a look that only a lungfish
could have copied.
"Fiscal policy ..." he repeated, "that is what I said."
"How can you have money," demanded Ford, "if none of you actually
produces anything? It doesn't grow on trees you know."
"If you would allow me to continue ..."
Ford nodded dejectedly.
"Thank you. Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as
legal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich."
Ford stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring
appreciatively at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves
with which their track suits were stuffed.
"But we have also," continued the Management Consultant, "run
into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of
leaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current going
rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship's
peanut."
Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd. The Management Consultant
waved them down.
"So in order to obviate this problem," he continued, "and
effectively revaluate the leaf, we are about to embark on a
massive defoliation campaign, and ... er, burn down all the
forests. I think you'll all agree that's a sensible move under
the circumstances."
The crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or
two until someone pointed out how much this would increase the
value of the leaves in their pockets whereupon they let out
whoops of delight and gave the Management Consultant a standing
ovation. The accountants amongst them looked forward to a
profitable Autumn.
"You're all mad," explained Ford Prefect.
"You're absolutely barmy," he suggested.
"You're a bunch of raving nutters," he opined.
The tide of opinion started to turn against him. What had started
out as excellent entertainment had now, in the crowd's view,
deteriorated into mere abuse, and since this abuse was in the
main directed at them they wearied of it.
Sensing this shift in the wind, the marketing girl turned on him.
"Is it perhaps in order," she demanded, "to inquire what you've
been doing all these months then? You and that other interloper
have been missing since the day we arrived."
"We've been on a journey," said Ford, "We went to try and find
out something about this planet."
"Oh," said the girl archly, "doesn't sound very productive to
me."
"No? Well have I got news for you, my love. We have discovered
this planet's future."
Ford waited for this statement to have its effect. It didn't have
any. They didn't know what he was talking about.
He continued.
"It doesn't matter a pair of fetid dingo's kidneys what you all
choose to do from now on. Burn down the forests, anything, it
won't make a scrap of difference. Your future history has already
happened. Two million years you've got and that's it. At the end
of that time your race will be dead, gone and good riddance to
you. Remember that, two million years!"
The crowd muttered to itself in annoyance. People as rich as they
had suddenly become shouldn't be obliged to listen to this sort
of gibberish. Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and
he would go away.
They didn't need to bother. Ford was already stalking out of the
clearing, pausing only to shake his head at Number Two who was
already firing his Kill-O-Zap gun into some neighbouring trees.
He turned back once.
"Two million years!" he said and laughed.
"Well," said the Captain with a soothing smile, "still time for a
few more baths. Could someone pass me the sponge? I just dropped
it over the side."
A mile or so away through the wood, Arthur Dent was too busily
engrossed with what he was doing to hear Ford Prefect approach.
What he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was: on
a wide flat piece of rock he had scratched out the shape of a
large square, subdivided into one hundred and sixty-nine smaller
squares, thirteen to a side.
Furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish
stones and scratched the shape of a letter on to each. Sitting
morosely round the rock were a couple of the surviving local
native men whom Arthur Dent was trying to introduce the curious
concept embodied in these stones.
So far they had not done well. They had attempted to eat some of
them, bury others and throw the rest of them away. Arthur had
finally encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones on the
board he had scratched out, which was not even as far as he'd
managed to get the day before. Along with the rapid deterioration
in the morale of these creatures, there seemed to be a
corresponding deterioration in their actual intelligence.
In an attempt to egg them along, Arthur set out a number of
letters on the board himself, and then tried to encourage the
natives to add some more themselves.
It was not going well.
Ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree.
"No," said Arthur to one of the natives who had just shuffled
some of the letters round in a fit of abysmal dejection, "Q
scores ten you see, and it's on a triple word score, so ... look,
I've explained the rules to you ... no no, look please, put down
that jawbone ... alright, we'll start again. And try to
concentrate this time."
Ford leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand against his
head.
"What are you doing, Arthur?" he asked quietly.
Arthur looked up with a start. He suddenly had a feeling that all
this might look slightly foolish. All he knew was that it had
worked like a dream on him when he was a chid. But things were
different then, or rather would be.
"I'm trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble," he said.
"They're not cavemen," said Ford.
"They look like cavemen."
Ford let it pass.
"I see," he said.
"It's uphill work," said Arthur wearily, "the only word they know
is grunt and they can't spell it."
He sighed and sat back.
"What's that supposed to achieve?" asked Ford.
"We've got to encourage them to evolve! To develop!" Arthur burst
out angrily. He hoped that the weary sigh and then the anger
might do something to counteract the overriding feeling of
foolishness from which he was currently suffering. It didn't. He
jumped to his feet.
"Can you imagine what a world would be like descended from those
... cretins we arrived with?" he said.
"Imagine?" said Ford, rising his eyebrows. "We don't have to
imagine. We've seen it."
"But ..." Arthur waved his arms about hopelessly.
"We've seen it," said Ford, "there's no escape."
Arthur kicked at a stone.
"Did you tell them what we've discovered?" he asked.
"Hmmmm?" said Ford, not really concentrating.
"Norway," said Arthur, "Slartibartfast's signature in the
glacier. Did you tell them?"
"What's the point?" said Ford, "What would it mean to them?"
"Mean?" said Arthur, "Mean? You know perfectly well what it
means. It means that this planet is the Earth! It's my home! It's
where I was born!"
"Was?" said Ford.
"Alright, will be."
"Yes, in two million years' time. Why don't you tell them that?
Go and say to them, Excuse me, I'd just like to point out that
in two million years' time I will be born just a few miles from
here.' See what they say. They'll chase you up a tree and set
fire to it."
Arthur absorbed this unhappily.
"Face it," said Ford, "those zeebs over there are your ancestors,
not these poor creatures here."
He went over to where the apemen creatures were rummaging
listlessly with the stone letters. He shook his head.
"Put the Scrabble away, Arthur," he said, "it won't save the
human race, because this lot aren't going to be the human race.
The human race is currently sitting round a rock on the other
side of this hill making documentaries about themselves."
Arthur winced.
"There must be something we can do," he said. A terrible sense of
desolation thrilled through his body that he should be here, on
the Earth, the Earth which had lost its future in a horrifying
arbitrary catastrophe and which now seemed set to lose its past
as well.
"No," said Ford, "there's nothing we can do. This doesn't change
the history of the Earth, you see, this is the history of the
Earth. Like it or leave it, the Golgafrinchans are the people you
are descended from. in two million years they get destroyed by
the Vogons. History is never altered you see, it just fits
together like a jigsaw. Funny old thing, life, isn't it?"
He picked up the letter Q and hurled it into a distant pivet bush
where it hit a young rabbit. The rabbit hurtled off in terror and
didn't stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox which choked
on one of its bones and died on the bank of a stream which
subsequently washed it away.
During the following weeks Ford Prefect swallowed his pride and
struck up a relationship with a girl who had been a personnel
officer on Golgafrincham, and he was terribly upset when she
suddenly passed away as a result of drinking water from a pool
that had been polluted by the body of a dead fox. The only moral
it is possible to draw from this story is that one should never
throw the letter Q into a pivet bush, but unfortunately there are
times when it is unavoidable.
Like most of the really crucial things in life, this chain of
events was completely invisible to Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent.
They were looking sadly at one of the natives morosely pushing
the other letters around.
"Poor bloody caveman," said Arthur.
"They're not ..."
"What?"
"Oh never mind."
The wretched creature let out a pathetic howling noise and banged
on the rock.
"It's all been a bit of waste of time for them, hasn't it?" said
Arthur.
"Uh uh urghhhhh," muttered the native and banged on the rock
again.
"They've been outevolved by telephone sanitizers."
"Urgh, gr gr, gruh!" insisted the native, continuing to bang on
the rock.
"Why does he keep banging on the rock?" said Arthur.
"I think he probably wants you to Scrabble with him again," said
Ford, "he's pointing at the letters."
"Probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again, poor bastard. I keep on
telling him there's only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc."
The native banged on the rock again.
They looked over his shoulder.
Their eyes popped.
There amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid
out in a clear straight line.
They spelt two words.
The words were these:
"Forty-Two."
"Grrrurgh guh guh," explained the native. He swept the letters
angrily away and went and mooched under a nearby tree with his
colleague.
Ford and Arthur stared at him. Then they stared at each other.
"Did that say what I thought it said?" they both said to each
other.
"Yes," they both said.
"Forty-two," said Arthur.
"Forty-two," said Ford.
Arthur ran over to the two natives.
"What are you trying to tell us?" he shouted. "What's it supposed
to mean?"
One of them rolled over on the ground, kicked his legs up in the
air, rolled over again and went to sleep.
The other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts at Ford
Prefect. Whatever it was they had to say, they had already said
it.
"You know what this means," said Ford.
"Not entirely."
"Forty-two is the number Deep Thought gave as being the Ultimate
Answer."
"Yes."
And the Earth is the computer Deep Thought designed and built to
calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer."
"So we are led to believe."
"And organic life was part of the computer matrix."
"If you say so."
"I do say so. That means that these natives, these apemen are an
integral part of the computer program, and that we and the
Golgafrinchans are not."
"But the cavemen are dying out and the Golgafrinchans are
obviously set to replace them."
"Exactly. So do you see what this means?"
"What?"
"Cock up," said Ford Prefect.
Arthur looked around him.
"This planet is having a pretty bloody time of it," he said.
Ford puzzled for a moment.
"Still, something must have come out of it," he said at last,
"because Marvin said he could see the Question printed in your
brain wave patterns."
"But ..."
"Probably the wrong one, or a distortion of the right one. It
might give us a clue though if we could find it. I don't see how
we can though."
They moped about for a bit. Arthur sat on the ground and started
pulling up bits of grass, but found that it wasn't an occupation
he could get deeply engrossed in. It wasn't grass he could
believe in, the trees seemed pointless, the rolling hills seemed
to be rolling to nowhere and the future seemed just a tunnel to
be crawled through.
Ford fiddled with his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It was silent. He
sighed and put it away.
Arthur picked up one of the letter stones from his home-made
Scrabble set. It was a T. He sighed and out it down again. The
letter he put down next to it was an I. That spelt IT. He tossed
another couple of letters next to them They were an S and an H as
it happened. By a curious coincidence the resulting word
perfectly expressed the way Arthur was feeling about things just
then. He stared at it for a moment. He hadn't done it
deliberately, it was just a random chance. His brain got slowly
into first gear.
"Ford," he said suddenly, "look, if that Question is printed in
my brain wave patterns but I'm not consciously aware of it it
must be somewhere in my unconscious."
"Yes, I suppose so."
"There might be a way of bringing that unconscious pattern
forward."
"Oh yes?"
"Yes, by introducing some random element that can be shaped by
that pattern."
"Like how?"
"Like by pulling Scrabble letters out of a bag blindfolded."
Ford leapt to his feet.
"Brilliant!" he said. He tugged his towel out of his satchel and
with a few deft knots transformed it into a bag.
"Totally mad," he said, "utter nonsense. But we'll do it because
it's brilliant nonsense. Come on, come on."
The sun passed respectfully behind a cloud. A few small sad
raindrops fell.
They piled together all the remaining letters and dropped them
into the bag. They shook them up.
"Right," said Ford, "close your eyes. Pull them out. Come on come
on, come on."
Arthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towelful of
stones. He jiggled them about, pulled out four and handed them to
Ford. Ford laid them along the ground in the order he got them.
"W," said Ford, "H, A, T ... What!"
He blinked.
"I think it's working!" he said.
Arthur pushed three more at him.
"D, O, Y ... Doy. Oh perhaps it isn't working," said Ford.
"Here's the next three."
"O, U, G ... Doyoug ... It's not making sense I'm afraid."
Arthur pulled another two from the bag. Ford put them in place.
"E, T, doyouget ... Do you get!" shouted Ford, "it is working!
This is amazing, it really is working!"
"More here." Arthur was throwing them out feverishly as fast as
he could go.
"I, F," said Ford, "Y, O, U, ... M, U, L, T, I, P, L, Y, ... What
do you get if you multiply, ... S, I, X, ... six, B, Y, by, six
by ... what do you get if you multiply six by ... N, I, N, E, ...
six by nine ..." He paused. "Come on, where's the next one?"
"Er, that's the lot," said Arthur, "that's all there were."
He sat back, nonplussed.
He rooted around again in the knotted up towel but there were no
more letters.
"You mean that's it?" said Ford.
"That's it."
"Six by nine. Forty-two."
"That's it. That's all there is."
The sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them. A bird sang. A
warm breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the
flowers, carrying their scent away through the woods. An insect
droned past on its way to do whatever it is that insects do in
the late afternoon. The sound of voices lilted through the trees
followed a moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise at
the sight of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent apparently lying on the
ground in agony, but in fact rocking with noiseless laughter.
"No, don't go," called Ford Prefect between gasps, "we'll be with
you in a moment."
"What's the matter?" asked one of the girls. She was the taller
and slimmer of the two. On Golgafrincham she had been a junior
personnel officer, but hadn't liked it much.
Ford pulled himself together.
"Excuse me," he said, "hello. My friend and I were just
contemplating the meaning of life. Frivolous exercise."
"Oh it's you," said the girl, "you made a bit of a spectacle of
yourself this afternoon. You were quite funny to begin with but
you did bang on a bit."
"Did I? Oh yes."
"Yes, what was all that for?" asked the other girl, a shorter
round-faced girl who had been an art director for a small
advertising company on Golgafrincham. Whatever the privations of
this world were, she went to sleep every night profoundly
grateful for the fact that whatever she had to face in the
morning it wouldn't be a hundred almost identical photographs of
moodily lit tubes of toothpaste.
"For? For nothing. Nothing's for anything," said Ford Prefect
happily. "Come and join us. I"m Ford, this is Arthur. We were
just about to do nothing at all for a while but it can wait."
The girls looked at them doubtfully.
"I'm Agda," said the tall one, "this is Mella."
"Hello Agda, hello Mella," said Ford.
"Do you talk at all?" said Mella to Arthur.
"Oh, eventually," said Arthur with a smile, "but not as much as
Ford."
"Good."
There was a slight pause.
"What did you mean," asked Agda, "about only having two million
years? I couldn't make sense of what you were saying."
"Oh that," said Ford, "it doesn't matter."
"It's just that the world gets demolished to make way for a
hyperspace bypass," said Arthur with a shrug, "but that's two
million years away, and anyway it's just Vogons doing what Vogons
do."
"Vogons?" said Mella.
"Yes, you wouldn't know them."
"Where'd you get this idea from?"
"It really doesn't matter. It's just like a dream from the past,
or the future." Arthur smiled and looked away.
"Does it worry you that you don't talk any kind of sense?" asked
Agda.
"Listen, forget it," said Ford, "forget all of it. Nothing
matters. Look, it's a beautiful day, enjoy it. The sun, the green
of the hills, the river down in the valley, the burning trees."
"Even if it's only a dream, it's a pretty horrible idea," said
Mella, "destroying a world just to make a bypass."
"Oh, I've heard of worse," said Ford, "I read of one planet off
in the seventh dimension that got used as a ball in a game of
intergalactic bar billiards. Got potted straight into a black
hole. Killed ten billion people."
"That's mad," said Mella.
"Yes, only scored thirty points too."
Agda and Mella exchanged glances.
"Look," said Agda, "there's a party after the committee meeting
tonight. You can come along if you like."
"Yeah, OK," said Ford.
"I'd like to," said Arthur.
Many hours later Arthur and Mella sat and watched the moon rise
over the dull red glow of the trees.
"That story about the world being destroyed ..." began Mella.
"In two million years, yes."
"You say it as if you really think it's true."
"Yes, I think it is. I think I was there."
She shook her head in puzzlement.
"You're very strange," she said.
"No, I'm very ordinary," said Arthur, "but some very strange
things have happened to me. You could say I'm more differed from
than differing."
"And that other world your friend talked about, the one that got
pushed into a black hole."
"Ah, that I don't know about. It sounds like something from the
book."
"What book?"
Arthur paused.
"The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy," he said at last.
"What's that?"
"Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening. I don't
think I'll be wanting it any more," said Arthur Dent.
The regular early morning yell of horror was the sound of Arthur
Dent waking up and suddenly remembering where he was.
It wasn't just that the cave was cold, it wasn't just that it was
damp and smelly. It was the fact that the cave was in the middle
of Islington and there wasn't a bus due for two million years.
Time is the worst place, so to speak, to get lost in, as Arthur
Dent could testify, having been lost in both time and space a
good deal. At least being lost in space kept you busy.
He was stranded in prehistoric Earth as the result of a complex
sequence of events which had involved him being alternately blown
up and insulted in more bizarre regions of the Galaxy than he
ever dreamt existed, and though his life had now turned very,
very, very quiet, he was still feeling jumpy.
He hadn't been blown up now for five years.
Since he had hardly seen anyone since he and Ford Prefect had
parted company four years previously, he hadn't been insulted in
all that time either.
Except just once.
It had happened on a spring evening about two years previously.
He was returning to his cave just a little after dusk when he
became aware of lights flashing eerily through the clouds. He
turned and stared, with hope suddenly clambering through his
heart. Rescue. Escape. The castaway's impossible dream - a ship.
And as he watched, as he stared in wonder and excitement, a long
silver ship descended through the warm evening air, quietly,
without fuss, its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of
technology.
It alighted gently on the ground, and what little hum it had
generated died away, as if lulled by the evening calm.
A ramp extended itself.
Light streamed out.
A tall figure appeared silhouetted in the hatchway. It walked
down the ramp and stood in front of Arthur.
"You're a jerk, Dent," it said simply.
It was alien, very alien. It had a peculiar alien tallness, a
peculiar alien flattened head, peculiar slitty little alien eyes,
extravagantly draped golden ropes with a peculiarly alien collar
design, and pale grey-green alien skin which had about it that
lustrous shine which most grey-green faces can only acquire with
plenty of exercise and very expensive soap.
Arthur boggled at it.
It gazed levelly at him.
Arthur's first sensations of hope and trepidation had instantly
been overwhelmed by astonishment, and all sorts of thoughts were
battling for the use of his vocal chords at this moment.
"Whh ...?" he said.
"Bu ... hu ... uh ..." he added.
"Ru ... ra ... wah ... who?" he managed finally to say and lapsed
into a frantic kind of silence. He was feeling the effects of
having not said anything to anybody for as long as he could
remember.
The alien creature frowned briefly and consulted what appeared to
be some species of clipboard which he was holding in his thin and
spindly alien hand.
"Arthur Dent?" it said.
Arthur nodded helplessly.
"Arthur Philip Dent?" pursued the alien in a kind of efficient
yap.
"Er ... er ... yes ... er ... er," confirmed Arthur.
"You're a jerk," repeated the alien, "a complete asshole."
"Er ..."
The creature nodded to itself, made a peculiar alien tick on its
clipboard and turned briskly back towards the ship.
"Er ..." said Arthur desperately, "er ..."
"Don't give me that!" snapped the alien. It marched up the ramp,
through the hatchway and disappeared into the ship. The ship
sealed itself. It started to make a low throbbing hum.
"Er, hey!" shouted Arthur, and started to run helplessly towards
it.
"Wait a minute!" he called. "What is this? What? Wait a minute!"
The ship rose, as if shedding its weight like a cloak to the
ground, and hovered briefly. It swept strangely up into the
evening sky. It passed up through the clouds, illuminating them
briefly, and then was gone, leaving Arthur alone in an immensity
of land dancing a helplessly tiny little dance.
"What?" he screamed. "What? What? Hey, what? Come back here and
say that!"
He jumped and danced until his legs trembled, and shouted till
his lungs rasped. There was no answer from anyone. There was no
one to hear him or speak to him.
The alien ship was already thundering towards the upper reaches
of the atmosphere, on its way out into the appalling void which
separates the very few things there are in the Universe from each
other.
Its occupant, the alien with the expensive complexion, leaned
back in its single seat. His name was Wowbagger the Infinitely
Prolonged. He was a man with a purpose. Not a very good purpose,
as he would have been the first to admit, but it was at least a
purpose and it did at least keep him on the move.
Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was --indeed, is - one of the
Universe's very small number of immortal beings.
Those who are born immortal instinctively know how to cope with
it, but Wowbagger was not one of them. Indeed he had come to hate
them, the load of serene bastards. He had had his immortality
thrust upon him by an unfortunate accident with an irrational
particle accelerator, a liquid lunch and a pair of rubber bands.
The precise details of the accident are not important because no
one has ever managed to duplicate the exact circumstances under
which it happened, and many people have ended up looking very
silly, or dead, or both, trying.
Wowbagger closed his eyes in a grim and weary expression, put
some light jazz on the ship's stereo, and reflected that he could
have made it if it hadn't been for Sunday afternoons, he really
could have done.
To begin with it was fun, he had a ball, living dangerously,
taking risks, cleaning up on high-yield long-term investments,
and just generally outliving the hell out of everybody.
In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't cope with,
and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about
., when you know that you've had all the baths you can
usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given
paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use
the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as
you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to
four o'clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the
soul.
So things began to pall for him. The merry smiles he used to wear
at other people's funerals began to fade. He began to despise the
Universe in general, and everyone in it in particular.
This was the point at which he conceived his purpose, the thing
which would drive him on, and which, as far as he could see,
would drive him on forever. It was this.
He would insult the Universe.
That is, he would insult everybody in it. Individually,
personally, one by one, and (this was the thing he really decided
to grit his teeth over) in alphabetical order.
When people protested to him, as they sometimes had done, that
the plan was not merely misguided but actually impossible because
of the number of people being born and dying all the time, he
would merely fix them with a steely look and say, "A man can
dream can't he?"
And so he started out. He equipped a spaceship that was built to
last with the computer capable of handling all the data
processing involved in keeping track of the entire population of
the known Universe and working out the horrifically complicated
routes involved.
His ship fled through the inner orbits of the Sol star system,
preparing to slingshot round the sun and fling itself out into
interstellar space.
"Computer," he said.
"Here," yipped the computer.
"Where next?"
"Computing that."
Wowbagger gazed for a moment at the fantastic jewellery of the
night, the billions of tiny diamond worlds that dusted the
infinite darkness with light. Every one, every single one, was on
his itinerary. Most of them he would be going to millions of
times over.
He imagined for a moment his itinerary connecting up all the dots
in the sky like a child's numbered dots puzzle. He hoped that
from some vantage point in the Universe it might be seen to spell
a very, very rude word.
The computer beeped tunelessly to indicate that it had finished
its calculations.
"Folfanga," it said. It beeped.
"Fourth world of the Folfanga system," it continued. It beeped
again.
"Estimated journey time, three weeks," it continued further. It
beeped again.
"There to meet with a small slug," it beeped, "of the genus A-
Rth-Urp-Hil-Ipdenu."
"I believe," it added, after a slight pause during which it
beeped, "that you had decided to call it a brainless prat."
Wowbagger grunted. He watched the majesty of creation outside his
window for a moment or two.
"I think I'll take a nap," he said, and then added, "what network
areas are we going to be passing through in the next few hours?"
The computer beeped.
"Cosmovid, Thinkpix and Home Brain Box," it said, and beeped.
"Any movies I haven't seen thirty thousand times already?"
"No."
"Uh."
"There's Angst in Space. You've only seen that thirty-three
thousand five hundred and seventeen times."
"Wake me for the second reel."
The computer beeped.
"Sleep well," it said.
The ship fled on through the night.
Meanwhile, on Earth, it began to pour with rain and Arthur Dent
sat in his cave and had one of the most truly rotten evenings of
his entire life, thinking of things he could have said to the
alien and swatting flies, who also had a rotten evening.
The next day he made himself a pouch out of rabbit skin because
he thought it would be useful to keep things in.
This morning, two years later than that, was sweet and fragrant
as he emerged from the cave he called home until he could think
of a better name for it or find a better cave.
Though his throat was sore again from his early morning yell of
horror, he was suddenly in a terrifically good mood. He wrapped
his dilapidated dressing gown tightly around him and beamed at
the bright morning.
The air was clear and scented, the breeze flitted lightly through
the tall grass around his cave, the birds were chirruping at each
other, the butterflies were flitting about prettily, and the
whole of nature seemed to be conspiring to be as pleasant as it
possibly could.
It wasn't all the pastoral delights that were making Arthur feel
so cheery, though. He had just had a wonderful idea about how to
cope with the terrible lonely isolation, the nightmares, the
failure of all his attempts at horticulture, and the sheer
futurelessness and futility of his life here on prehistoric
Earth, which was that he would go mad.
He beamed again and took a bite out of a rabbit leg left over
from his supper. He chewed happily for a few moments and then
decided formally to announce his decision.
He stood up straight and looked the world squarely in the fields
and hills. To add weight to his words he stuck the rabbit bone in
his hair. He spread his arms out wide.
"I will go mad!" he announced.
"Good idea," said Ford Prefect, clambering down from the rock on
which he had been sitting.
Arthur's brain somersaulted. His jaw did press-ups.
"I went mad for a while," said Ford, "did me no end of good."
"You see," said Ford, "- ..."
"Where have you been?" interrupted Arthur, now that his head had
finished working out.
"Around," said Ford, "around and about." He grinned in what he
accurately judged to be an infuriating manner. "I just took my
mind off the hook for a bit. I reckoned that if the world wanted
me badly enough it would call back. It did."
 He took out of his now terribly battered and dilapidated satchel
his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic.
"At least," he said, "I think it did. This has been playing up a
bit." He shook it. "If it was a false alarm I shall go mad," he
said, "again."
Arthur shook his head and sat down. He looked up.
"I thought you must be dead ..." he said simply.
"So did I for a while," said Ford, "and then I decided I was a
lemon for a couple of weeks. A kept myself amused all that time
jumping in and out of a gin and tonic."
Arthur cleared his throat, and then did it again.
"Where," he said, "did you ...?"
"Find a gin and tonic?" said Ford brightly. "I found a small lake
that thought it was a gin and tonic, and jumped in and out of
that. At least, I think it thought it was a gin and tonic."
"I may," he added with a grin which would have sent sane men
scampering into trees, "have been imagining it."
He waited for a reaction from Arthur, but Arthur knew better than
that.
"Carry on," he said levelly.
"The point is, you see," said Ford, "that there is no point in
driving yourself mad trying to stop yourself going mad. You might
just as well give in and save your sanity for later."
"And this is you sane again, is it?" said Arthur. "I ask merely
for information."
"I went to Africa," said Ford.
"Yes?"
"Yes."
"What was that like?"
"And this is your cave is it?" said Ford.
"Er, yes," said Arthur. He felt very strange. After nearly four
years of total isolation he was so pleased and relieved to see
Ford that he could almost cry. Ford was, on the other hand, an
almost immediately annoying person.
"Very nice," said Ford, in reference to Arthur's cave. "You must
hate it."
Arthur didn't bother to reply.
"Africa was very interesting," said Ford, "I behaved very oddly
there."
He gazed thoughtfully into the distance.
"I took up being cruel to animals," he said airily. "But only,"
he added, "as a hobby."
"Oh yes," said Arthur, warily.
"Yes," Ford assured him. "I won't disturb you with the details
because they would -"
"What?"
"Disturb you. But you may be interested to know that I am
singlehandedly responsible for the evolved shape of the animal
you came to know in later centuries as a giraffe. And I tried to
learn to fly. Do you believe me?"
"Tell me," said Arthur.
"I'll tell you later. I'll just mention that the Guide says ..."
"The ...?"
"Guide. The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. You remember?"
"Yes. I remember throwing it in the river."
"Yes," said Ford, "but I fished it out."
"You didn't tell me."
"I didn't want you to throw it in again."
"Fair enough," admitted Arthur. "It says?"
"What?"
"The Guide says?"
"The Guide says there is an art to flying," said Ford, "or rather
a knack. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the
ground and miss." He smiled weakly. He pointed at the knees of
his trousers and held his arms up to show the elbows. They were
all torn and worn through.
"I haven't done very well so far," he said. He stuck out his
hand. "I'm very glad to see you again, Arthur," he added.
Arthur shook his head in a sudden access of emotion and
bewilderment.
"I haven't seen anyone for years," he said, "not anyone. I can
hardly even remember how to speak. I keep forgetting words. I
practise you see. I practise by talking to ... talking to ...
what are those things people think you're mad if you talk to?
Like George the Third."
"Kings?" suggested Ford.
"No, no," said Arthur. "The things he used to talk to. We're
surrounded by them for heaven's sake. I've planted hundreds
myself. They all died. Trees! I practise by talking to trees.
What's that for?"
Ford still had his hand stuck out. Arthur looked at it with
incomprehension.
"Shake," prompted Ford.
Arthur did, nervously at first, as if it might turn out to be a
fish. Then he grasped it vigorously with both hands in an
overwhelming flood of relief. He shook it and shook it.
After a while Ford found it necessary to disengage. They climbed
to the top of a nearby outcrop of rock and surveyed the scene
around them.
"What happened to the Golgafrinchans?" asked Ford.
Arthur shrugged.
"A lot of them didn't make it through the winter three years
ago," he said, "and the few who remained in the spring said they
needed a holiday and set off on a raft. History says that they
must have survived ..."
"Huh," said Ford, "well well." He stuck his hands on his hips and
looked round again at the empty world. Suddenly, there was about
Ford a sense of energy and purpose.
"We're going," he said excitedly, and shivered with energy.
"Where? How?" said Arthur.
"I don't know," said Ford, "but I just feel that the time is
right. Things are going to happen. We're on our way."
He lowered his voice to a whisper.
"I have detected," he said, "disturbances in the wash."
He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite
like the wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point,
but the wind was busy fooling around with some leaves a little
way off.
Arthur asked him to repeat what he had just said because he
hadn't quite taken his meaning. Ford repeated it.
"The wash?" said Arthur.
"The space-time wash," said Ford, and as the wind blew briefly
past at that moment, he bared his teeth into it.
Arthur nodded, and then cleared his throat.
"Are we talking about," he asked cautiously, "some sort of Vogon
laundromat, or what are we talking about?"
"Eddies," said Ford, "in the space-time continuum."
"Ah," nodded Arthur, "is he? Is he?" He pushed his hands into the
pocket of his dressing gown and looked knowledgeably into the
distance.
"What?" said Ford.
"Er, who," said Arthur, "is Eddy, then, exactly?"
Ford looked angrily at him.
"Will you listen?" he snapped.
"I have been listening," said Arthur, "but I'm not sure it's
helped."
Ford grasped him by the lapels of his dressing gown and spoke to
him as slowly and distinctly and patiently as if he were somebody
from a telephone company accounts department.
"There seem ..." he said, "to be some pools ..." he said, "of
instability ..." he said, "in the fabric ..." he said ...
Arthur looked foolishly at the cloth of his dressing gown where
Ford was holding it. Ford swept on before Arthur could turn the
foolish look into a foolish remark.
"... in the fabric of space-time," he said.
"Ah, that," said Arthur.
"Yes, that," confirmed Ford.
They stood there alone on a hill on prehistoric Earth and stared
each other resolutely in the face.
"And it's done what?" said Arthur.
"It," said Ford, "has developed pools of instability."
"Has it?" said Arthur, his eyes not wavering for a moment.
"It has," said Ford with a similar degree of ocular immobility.
"Good," said Arthur.
"See?" said Ford.
"No," said Arthur.
There was a quiet pause.
"The difficulty with this conversation," said Arthur after a sort
of pondering look had crawled slowly across his face like a
mountaineer negotiating a tricky outcrop, "is that it's very
different from most of the ones I've had of late. Which, as I
explained, have mostly been with trees. They weren't like this.
Except perhaps some of the ones I've had with elms which
sometimes get a bit bogged down."
"Arthur," said Ford.
"Hello? Yes?" said Arthur.
"Just believe everything I tell you, and it will all be very,
very simple."
"Ah, well I'm not sure I believe that."
They sat down and composed their thoughts.
Ford got out his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It was making vague
humming noises and a tiny light on it was flickering faintly.
"Flat battery?" said Arthur.
"No," said Ford, "there is a moving disturbance in the fabric of
space-time, an eddy, a pool of instability, and it's somewhere in
our vicinity."
"Where?"
Ford moved the device in a slow lightly bobbing semi-circle.
Suddenly the light flashed.
"There!" said Ford, shooting out his arm. "There, behind that
sofa!"
Arthur looked. Much to his surprise, there was a velvet paisley-
covered Chesterfield sofa in the field in front of them. He
boggled intelligently at it. Shrewd questions sprang into his
mind.
"Why," he said, "is there a sofa in that field?"
"I told you!" shouted Ford, leaping to his feet. "Eddies in the
space-time continuum!"
"And this is his sofa, is it?" asked Arthur, struggling to his
feet and, he hoped, though not very optimistically, to his
senses.
"Arthur!" shouted Ford at him, "that sofa is there because of the
space-time instability I've been trying to get your terminally
softened brain to get to grips with. It's been washed out of the
continuum, it's space-time jetsam, it doesn't matter what it is,
we've got to catch it, it's our only way out of here!"
He scrambled rapidly down the rocky outcrop and made off across
the field.
"Catch it?" muttered Arthur, then frowned in bemusement as he saw
that the Chesterfield was lazily bobbing and wafting away across
the grass.
With a whoop of utterly unexpected delight he leapt down the rock
and plunged off in hectic pursuit of Ford Prefect and the
irrational piece of furniture.
They careered wildly through the grass, leaping, laughing,
shouting instructions to each other to head the thing off this
way or that way. The sun shone dreamily on the swaying grass,
tiny field animals scattered crazily in their wake.
Arthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day was for
once working out so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes
ago he had decided he would go mad, and now he was already
chasing a Chesterfield sofa across the fields of prehistoric
Earth.
The sofa bobbed this way and that and seemed simultaneously to be
as solid as the trees as it drifted past some of them and hazy as
a billowing dream as it floated like a ghost through others.
Ford and Arthur pounded chaotically after it, but it dodged and
weaved as if following its own complex mathematical topography,
which it was. Still they pursued, still it danced and span, and
suddenly turned and dipped as if crossing the lip of a
catastrophe graph, and they were practically on top of it. With a
heave and a shout they leapt on it, the sun winked out, they fell
through a sickening nothingness, and emerged unexpectedly in the
middle of the pitch at Lord's Cricked Ground, St John's Wood,
London, towards the end of the last Test Match of the Australian
Series in the year -, with England needing only twenty-eight
runs to win.
Important facts from Galactic history, number one:
(Reproduced from the Siderial Daily Mentioner's Book of popular
Galactic History.)
The night sky over the planet Krikkit is the least interesting
sight in the entire Universe.
It was a charming and delightful day at Lord's as Ford and Arthur
tumbled haphazardly out of a space-time anomaly and hit the
immaculate turf rather hard.
The applause of the crowd was tremendous. It wasn't for them, but
instinctively they bowed anyway, which was fortunate because the
small red heavy ball which the crowd actually had been applauding
whistled mere millimetres over Arthur's head. In the crowd a man
collapsed.
They threw themselves back to the ground which seemed to spin
hideously around them.
"What was that?" hissed Arthur.
"Something red," hissed Ford back at him.
"Where are we?"
"Er, somewhere green."
"Shapes," muttered Arthur. "I need shapes."
The applause of the crowd had been rapidly succeeded by gasps of
astonishment, and the awkward titters of hundreds of people who
could not yet make up their minds about whether to believe what
they had just seen or not.
"This your sofa?" said a voice.
"What was that?" whispered Ford.
Arthur looked up.
"Something blue," he said.
"Shape?" said Ford.
Arthur looked again.
"It is shaped," he hissed at Ford, with his brow savagely
furrowing, "like a policeman."
They remained crouched there for a few moments, frowning deeply.
The blue thing shaped like a policeman tapped them both on the
shoulders.
"Come on, you two," the shape said, "let's be having you."
These words had an electrifying effect on Arthur. He leapt to his
feet like an author hearing the phone ring and shot a series of
startled glanced at the panorama around him which had suddenly
settled down into something of quite terrifying ordinariness.
"Where did you get this from?" he yelled at the policeman shape.
"What did you say?" said the startled shape.
"This is Lord's Cricket Ground, isn't it?" snapped Arthur. "Where
did you find it, how did you get it here? I think," he added,
clasping his hand to his brow, "that I had better calm down." He
squatted down abruptly in front of Ford.
"It is a policeman," he said, "What do we do?"
Ford shrugged.
"What do you want to do?" he said.
"I want you," said Arthur, "to tell me that I have been dreaming
for the last five years."
Ford shrugged again, and obliged.
"You've been dreaming for the last five years," he said.
Arthur got to his feet.
"It's all right, officer," he said. "I've been dreaming for the
last five years. Ask him," he added, pointing at Ford, "he was in
it."
Having said this, he sauntered off towards the edge of the pitch,
brushing down his dressing gown. He then noticed his dressing
gown and stopped. He stared at it. He flung himself at the
policeman.
"So where did I get these clothes from?" he howled.
He collapsed and lay twitching on the grass.
Ford shook his head.
"He's had a bad two million years," he said to the policeman, and
together they heaved Arthur on to the sofa and carried him off
the pitch and were only briefly hampered by the sudden
disappearance of the sofa on the way.
Reaction to all this from the crowd were many and various. Most
of them couldn't cope with watching it, and listened to it on the
radio instead.
"Well, this is an interesting incident, Brian," said one radio
commentator to another. "I don't think there have been any
mysterious materializations on the pitch since, oh since, well I
don't think there have been any - have there? - that I recall?"
"Edgbaston, ?"
"Ah, now what happened then ..."
"Well, Peter, I think it was Canter facing Willcox coming up to
bowl from the pavilion end when a spectator suddenly ran straight
across the pitch."
There was a pause while the first commentator considered this.
"Ye ... e ... s ..." he said, "yes, there's nothing actually very
mysterious about that, is there? He didn't actually materialize,
did he? Just ran on."
"No, that's true, but he did claim to have seen something
materialize on the pitch."
"Ah, did he?"
"Yes. An alligator, I think, of some description."
"Ah. And had anyone else noticed it?"
"Apparently not. And no one was able to get a very detailed
description from him, so only the most perfunctory search was
made."
"And what happened to the man?"
"Well, I think someone offered to take him off and give him some
lunch, but he explained that he'd already had a rather good one,
so the matter was dropped and Warwickshire went on to win by
three wickets."
"So, not very like this current instance. For those of you who've
just tuned in, you may be interested to know that, er ... two
men, two rather scruffily attired men, and indeed a sofa - a
Chesterfield I think?"
"Yes, a Chesterfield."
"Have just materialized here in the middle of Lord's Cricket
Ground. But I don't think they meant any harm, they've been very
good-natured about it, and ..."
"Sorry, can I interrupt you a moment Peter and say that the sofa
has just vanished."
"So it has. Well, that's one mystery less. Still, it's definitely
one for the record books I think, particularly occurring at this
dramatic moment in play, England now needing only twenty-four
runs to win the series. The men are leaving the pitch in the
company of a police officer, and I think everyone's settling down
now and play is about to resume."
"Now, sir," said the policeman after they had made a passage
through the curious crowd and laid Arthur's peacefully inert body
on a blanket, "perhaps you'd care to tell me who you are, where
you come from, and what that little scene was all about?"
Ford looked at the ground for a moment as if steadying himself
for something, then he straightened up and aimed a look at the
policeman which hit him with the full force of every inch of the
six hundred light-years' distance between Earth and Ford's home
near Betelgeuse.
"All right," said Ford, very quietly, "I'll tell you."
"Yes, well, that won't be necessary," said the policeman
hurriedly, "just don't let whatever it was happen again." The
policeman turned around and wandered off in search of anyone who
wasn't from Betelgeuse. Fortunately, the ground was full of them.
Arthur's consciousness approached his body as from a great
distance, and reluctantly. It had had some bad times in there.
Slowly, nervously, it entered and settled down in to its
accustomed position.
Arthur sat up.
"Where am I?" he said.
"Lord's Cricket Ground," said Ford.
"Fine," said Arthur, and his consciousness stepped out again for
a quick breather. His body flopped back on the grass.
Ten minutes later, hunched over a cup of tea in the refreshment
tent, the colour started to come back to his haggard face.
"How're you feeling?" said Ford.
"I'm home," said Arthur hoarsely. He closed his eyes and greedily
inhaled the steam from his tea as if it was - well, as far as
Arthur was concerned, as if it was tea, which it was.
"I'm home," he repeated, "home. It's England, it's today, the
nightmare is over." He opened his eyes again and smiled serenely.
"I'm where I belong," he said in an emotional whisper.
"There are two things I fell which I should tell you," said Ford,
tossing a copy of the Guardian over the table at him.
"I'm home," said Arthur.
"Yes," said Ford. "One is," he said pointing at the date at the
top of the paper, "that the Earth will be demolished in two days'
time."
"I'm home," said Arthur. "Tea," he said, "cricket," he added with
pleasure, "mown grass, wooden benches, white linen jackets, beer
cans ..."
Slowly he began to focus on the newspaper. He cocked his head on
one side with a slight frown.
"I've seen that one before," he said. His eyes wandered slowly up
to the date, which Ford was idly tapping at. His face froze for a
second or two and then began to do that terribly slow crashing
trick which Arctic ice-floes do so spectacularly in the spring.
"And the other thing," said Ford, "is that you appear to have a
bone in your beard." He tossed back his tea.
Outside the refreshment tent, the sun was shining on a happy
crowd. It shone on white hats and red faces. It shone on ice
lollies and melted them. It shone on the tears of small children
whose ice lollies had just melted and fallen off the stick. It
shone on the trees, it flashed off whirling cricket bats, it
gleamed off the utterly extraordinary object which was parked
behind the sight-screens and which nobody appeared to have
noticed. It beamed on Ford and Arthur as they emerged blinking
from the refreshment tent and surveyed the scene around them.
Arthur was shaking.
"Perhaps," he said, "I should ..."
"No," said Ford sharply.
"What?" said Arthur.
"Don't try and phone yourself up at home."
"How did you know ...?"
Ford shrugged.
"But why not?" said Arthur.
"People who talk to themselves on the phone," said Ford, "never
learn anything to their advantage."
"But ..."
"Look," said Ford. He picked up an imaginary phone and dialled an
imaginary dial.
"Hello?" he said into the imaginary mouthpiece. "Is that Arthur
Dent? Ah, hello, yes. This is Arthur Dent speaking. Don't hang
up."
He looked at the imaginary mouthpiece in disappointment.
"He hung up," he said, shrugged, and put the imaginary phone
neatly back on its imaginary hook.
"This is not my first temporal anomaly," he added.
A glummer look replaced the already glum look on Arthur Dent's
face.
"So we're not home and dry," he said.
"We could not even be said," replied Ford, "to be home and
vigorously towelling ourselves off."
The game continued. The bowler approached the wicket at a lope, a
trot, and then a run. He suddenly exploded in a flurry of arms
and legs, out of which flew a ball. The batsman swung and
thwacked it behind him over the sight-screens. Ford's eyes
followed the trajectory of the ball and jogged momentarily. He
stiffened. He looked along the flight path of the ball again and
his eyes twitched again.
"This isn't my towel," said Arthur, who was rummaging in his
rabbit-skin bag.
"Shhh," said Ford. He screwed his eyes up in concentration.
"I had a Golgafrinchan jogging towel," continued Arthur, "it was
blue with yellow stars on it. This isn't it."
"Shhh," said Ford again. He covered one eye and looked with the
other.
"This one's pink," said Arthur, "it isn't yours is it?"
"I would like you to shut up about your towel," said Ford.
"It isn't my towel," insisted Arthur, "that is the point I am
trying to ..."
"And the time at which I would like you to shut up about it,"
continued Ford in a low growl, "is now."
"All right," said Arthur, starting to stuff it back into the
primitively stitched rabbit-skin bag. "I realize that it is
probably not important in the cosmic scale of things, it's just
odd, that's all. A pink towel suddenly, instead of a blue one
with yellow stars."
Ford was beginning to behave rather strangely, or rather not
actually beginning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in
a way which was strangely different from the other strange ways
in which he more regularly behaved. What he was doing was this.
Regardless of the bemused stares it was provoking from his fellow
members of the crowd gathered round the pitch, he was waving his
hands in sharp movements across his face, ducking down behind
some people, leaping up behind others, then standing still and
blinking a lot. After a moment or two of this he started to stalk
forward slowly and stealthily wearing a puzzled frown of
concentration, like a leopard that's not sure whether it's just
seen a half-empty tin of cat food half a mile away across a hot
and dusty plain.
"This isn't my bag either," said Arthur suddenly.
Ford's spell of concentration was broken. He turned angrily on
Arthur.
"I wasn't talking about my towel," said Arthur. "We've
established that that isn't mine. It's just that the bag into
which I was putting the towel which is not mine is also not mine,
though it is extraordinarily similar. Now personally I think that
that is extremely odd, especially as the bag was one I made
myself on prehistoric Earth. These are also not my stones," he
added, pulling a few flat grey stones out of the bag. "I was
making a collection of interesting stones and these are clearly
very dull ones."
A roar of excitement thrilled through the crowd and obliterated
whatever it was that Ford said in reply to this piece of
information. The cricket ball which had excited this reaction
fell out of the sky and dropped neatly into Arthur's mysterious
rabbit-skin bag.
"Now I would say that that was also a very curious event," said
Arthur, rapidly closing the bag and pretending to look for the
ball on the ground.
"I don't think it's here," he said to the small boys who
immediately clustered round him to join in the search, "it
probably rolled off somewhere. Over there I expect." He pointed
vaguely in the direction in which he wished they would push off.
One of the boys looked at him quizzically.
"You all right?" said the boy.
"No," said Arthur.
"Then why you got a bone in your beard?" said the boy.
"I'm training it to like being wherever it's put." Arthur prided
himself on saying this. It was, he thought, exactly the sort of
thing which would entertain and stimulate young minds.
"Oh," said the small boy, putting his head to one side and
thinking about it. "What's your name?"
"Dent," said Arthur, "Arthur Dent."
"You're a jerk, Dent," said the boy, "a complete asshole." The
boy looked past him at something else, to show that he wasn't in
any particular hurry to run away, and then wandered off
scratching his nose. Suddenly Arthur remembered that the Earth
was going to be demolished again in two days' time, and just this
once didn't feel too bad about it.
Play resumed with a new ball, the sun continued to shine and Ford
continued to jump up and down shaking his head and blinking.
"Something's on your mind, isn't it?" said Arthur.
"I think," said Ford in a tone of voice which Arthur by now
recognized as one which presaged something utterly
unintelligible, "that there's an SEP over there."
He pointed. Curiously enough, the direction he pointed in was not
the one in which he was looking. Arthur looked in the one
direction, which was towards the sight-screens, and in the other
which was at the field of play. He nodded, he shrugged. He
shrugged again.
"A what?" he said.
"An SEP."
"An S ...?"
"... EP."
"And what's that?"
"Somebody Else's Problem."
"Ah, good," said Arthur and relaxed. He had no idea what all that
was about, but at least it seemed to be over. It wasn't.
"Over there," said Ford, again pointing at the sight-screens and
looking at the pitch.
"Where?" said Arthur.
"There!" said Ford.
"I see," said Arthur, who didn't.
"You do?" said Ford.
"What?" said Arthur.
"Can you see," said Ford patiently, "the SEP?"
"I thought you said that was somebody else's problem."
"That's right."
Arthur nodded slowly, carefully and with an air of immense
stupidity.
"And I want to know," said Ford, "if you can see it."
"You do?"
"Yes."
"What," said Arthur, "does it look like?"
"Well, how should I know, you fool?" shouted Ford. "If you can
see it, you tell me."
Arthur experienced that dull throbbing sensation just behind the
temples which was a hallmark of so many of his conversations with
Ford. His brain lurked like a frightened puppy in its kennel.
Ford took him by the arm.
"An SEP," he said, "is something that we can't see, or don't see,
or our brain doesn't let us see, because we think that it's
somebody else's problem. That's what SEP means. Somebody Else's
Problem. The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot. If
you look at it directly you won't see it unless you know
precisely what it is. Your only hope is to catch it by surprise
out of the corner of your eye."
"Ah," said Arthur, "then that's why ..."
"Yes," said Ford, who knew what Arthur was going to say.
"... you've been jumping up and ..."
"Yes."
"... down, and blinking ..."
"Yes."
"... and ..."
"I think you've got the message."
"I can see it," said Arthur, "it's a spaceship."
For a moment Arthur was stunned by the reaction this revelation
provoked. A roar erupted from the crowd, and from every direction
people were running, shouting, yelling, tumbling over each other
in a tumult of confusion. He stumbled back in astonishment and
glanced fearfully around. Then he glanced around again in even
greater astonishment.
"Exciting, isn't it?" said an apparition. The apparition wobbled
in front of Arthur's eyes, though the truth of the matter is
probably that Arthur's eyes were wobbling in front of the
apparition. His mouth wobbled as well.
"W ... w ... w ... w ..." his mouth said.
"I think your team have just won," said the apparition.
"W ... w ... w ... w ..." repeated Arthur, and punctuated each
wobble with a prod at Ford Prefect's back. Ford was staring at
the tumult in trepidation.
"You are English, aren't you?" said the apparition.
"W ... w ... w ... w ... yes" said Arthur.
"Well, your team, as I say, have just won. The match. It means
they retain the Ashes. You must be very pleased. I must say, I'm
rather fond of cricket, though I wouldn't like anyone outside
this planet to hear me saying that. Oh dear no."
The apparition gave what looked as if it might have been a
mischievous grin, but it was hard to tell because the sun was
directly behind him, creating a blinding halo round his head and
illuminating his silver hair and beard in a way which was
awesome, dramatic and hard to reconcile with mischievous grins.
"Still," he said, "it'll all be over in a couple of days, won't
it? Though as I said to you when we last met, I was very sorry
about that. Still, whatever will have been, will have been."
Arthur tried to speak, but gave up the unequal struggle. He
prodded Ford again.
"I thought something terrible had happened," said Ford, "but it's
just the end of the game. We ought to get out. Oh, hello,
Slartibartfast, what are you doing here?"
"Oh, pottering, pottering," said the old man gravely.
"That your ship? Can you give us a lift anywhere?"
"Patience, patience," the old man admonished.
"OK," said Ford. "It's just that this planet's going to be
demolished pretty soon."
"I know that," said Slartibartfast.
"And, well, I just wanted to make that point," said Ford.
"The point is taken."
And if you feel that you really want to hang around a cricket
pitch at this point ..."
"I do."
"Then it's your ship."
"It is."
"I suppose." Ford turned away sharply at this point.
"Hello, Slartibartfast," said Arthur at last.
"Hello, Earthman," said Slartibartfast.
"After all," said Ford, "we can only die once."
The old man ignored this and stared keenly on to the pitch, with
eyes that seemed alive with expressions that had no apparent
bearing on what was happening out there. What was happening was
that the crowd was gathering itself into a wide circle round the
centre of the pitch. What Slartibartfast saw in it, he alone
knew.
Ford was humming something. It was just one note repeated at
intervals. He was hoping that somebody would ask him what he was
humming, but nobody did. If anybody had asked him he would have
said he was humming the first line of a Noel Coward song called
"Mad About the Boy" over and over again. It would then have been
pointed out to him that he was only singing one note, to which he
would have replied that for reasons which he hoped would be
apparent, he was omitting the "about the boy" bit. He was annoyed
that nobody asked.
"It's just," he burst out at last, "that if we don't go soon, we
might get caught in the middle of it all again. And there's
nothing that depresses me more than seeing a planet being
destroyed. Except possibly still being on it when it happens.
Or," he added in an undertone, "hanging around cricket matches."
"Patience," said Slartibartfast again. "Great things are afoot."
"That's what you said last time we met," said Arthur.
"They were," said Slartibartfast.
"Yes, that's true," admitted Arthur.
All, however, that seemed to be afoot was a ceremony of some
kind. It was being specially staged for the benefit of tv rather
than the spectators, and all they could gather about it from
where they were standing was what they heard from a nearby radio.
Ford was aggressively uninterested.
He fretted as he heard it explained that the Ashes were about to
be presented to the Captain of the English team out there on the
pitch, fumed when told that this was because they had now won
them for the nth time, positively barked with annoyance at the
information that the Ashes were the remains of a cricket stump,
and when, further to this, he was asked to contend with the fact
that the cricket stump in question had been burnt in Melbourne,
Australia, in , to signify the "death of English cricket", he
rounded on Slartibartfast, took a deep breath, but didn't have a
chance to say anything because the old man wasn't there. He was
marching out on to the pitch with terrible purpose in his gait,
his hair, beard and robes swept behind him, looking very much as
Moses would have looked if Sinai had been a well-cut lawn instead
of, as it is more usually represented, a fiery smoking mountain.
"He said to meet him at his ship," said Arthur.
"What in the name of zarking fardwarks is the old fool doing?"
exploded Ford.
"Meeting us at his ship in two minutes," said Arthur with a shrug
which indicated total abdication of thought. They started off
towards it. Strange sounds reached their ears. They tried not to
listen, but could not help noticing that Slartibartfast was
querulously demanding that he be given the silver urn containing
the Ashes, as they were, he said, "vitally important for the
past, present and future safety of the Galaxy", and that this was
causing wild hilarity. They resolved to ignore it.
What happened next they could not ignore. With a noise like a
hundred thousand people saying "wop", a steely white spaceship
suddenly seemed to create itself out of nothing in the air
directly above the cricket pitch and hung there with infinite
menace and a slight hum.
Then for a while it did nothing, as if it expected everybody to
go about their normal business and not mind it just hanging
there.
Then it did something quite extraordinary. Or rather, it opened
up and let something quite extraordinary come out of it, eleven
quite extraordinary things.
They were robots, white robots.
What was most extraordinary about them was that they appeared to
have come dressed for the occasion. Not only were they white, but
they carried what appeared to be cricket bats, and not only that,
but they also carried what appeared to be cricket balls, and not
only that but they wore white ribbing pads round the lower parts
of their legs. These last were extraordinary because they
appeared to contain jets which allowed these curiously civilized
robots to fly down from their hovering spaceship and start to
kill people, which is what they did
"Hello," said Arthur, "something seems to be happening."
"Get to the ship," shouted Ford. "I don't want to know, I don't
want to see, I don't want to hear," he yelled as he ran, "this is
not my planet, I didn't choose to be here, I don't want to get
involved, just get me out of here, and get me to a party, with
people I can relate to!"
Smoke and flame billowed from the pitch.
"Well, the supernatural brigade certainly seems to be out in
force here today ..." burbled a radio happily to itself.
"What I need," shouted Ford, by way of clarifying his previous
remarks, "is a strong drink and a peer-group." He continued to
run, pausing only for a moment to grab Arthur's arm and drag him
along with him. Arthur had adopted his normal crisis role, which
was to stand with his mouth hanging open and let it all wash over
him.
"They're playing cricket," muttered Arthur, stumbling along after
Ford. "I swear they are playing cricket. I do not know why they
are doing this, but that is what they are doing. They're not just
killing people, they're sending them up," he shouted, "Ford,
they're sending us up!"
It would have been hard to disbelieve this without knowing a
great deal more Galactic history than Arthur had so far managed
to pick up in his travels. The ghostly but violent shapes that
could be seen moving within the thick pall of smoke seemed to be
performing a series of bizarre parodies of batting strokes, the
difference being that every ball they struck with their bats
exploded wherever it landed. The very first one of these had
dispelled Arthur's initial reaction, that the whole thing might
just be a publicity stunt by Australian margarine manufacturers.
And then, as suddenly as it had all started, it was over. The
eleven white robots ascended through the seething cloud in a
tight formation, and with a few last flashes of flame entered the
bowels of their hovering white ship, which, with the noise of a
hundred thousand people saying "foop", promptly vanished into the
thin air out of which it had wopped.
For a moment there was a terrible stunned silence, and then out
of the drifting smoke emerged the pale figure of Slartibartfast
looking even more like Moses because in spite of the continued
absence of the mountain he was at least now striding across a
fiery and smoking well-mown lawn.
He stared wildly about him until he saw the hurrying figures of
Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect forcing their way through the
frightened crowd which was for the moment busy stampeding in the
opposite direction. The crowd was clearly thinking to itself
about what an unusual day this was turning out to be, and not
really knowing which way, if any, to turn.
Slartibartfast was gesturing urgently at Ford and Arthur and
shouting at them, as the three of them gradually converged on his
ship, still parked behind the sight-screens and still apparently
unnoticed by the crowd stampeding past it who presumably had
enough of their own problems to cope with at that time.
"They've garble warble farble!" shouted Slartibartfast in his
thin tremulous voice.
"What did he say?" panted Ford as he elbowed his way onwards.
Arthur shook his head.
"They've ...' something or other," he said.
"They've table warble farble!" shouted Slartibartfast again.
Ford and Arthur shook their heads at each other.
"It sounds urgent," said Arthur. He stopped and shouted.
"What?"
"They've garble warble fashes!" cried Slartibartfast, still
waving at them.
"He says," said Arthur, "that they've taken the Ashes. That is
what I think he says." They ran on.
"The ...?" said Ford.
"Ashes," said Arthur tersely. "The burnt remains of a cricket
stump. It's a trophy. That ..." he was panting, "is ...
apparently ... what they ... have come and taken." He shook his
head very slightly as if he was trying to get his brain to settle
down lower in his skull.
"Strange thing to want to tell us," snapped Ford.
"Strange thing to take."
"Strange ship."
They had arrived at it. The second strangest thing about the ship
was watching the Somebody Else's Problem field at work. They
could now clearly see the ship for what it was simply because
they knew it was there. It was quite apparent, however, that
nobody else could. This wasn't because it was actually invisible
or anything hyper-impossible like that. The technology involved
in making anything invisible is so infinitely complex that nine
hundred and ninety-nine thousand million, nine hundred and
ninety-nine million, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand, nine
hundred and ninety-nine times out of a billion it is much simpler
and more effective just to take the thing away and do without it.
The ultra-famous sciento-magician Effrafax of Wug once bet his
life that, given a year, he could render the great megamountain
Magramal entirely invisible.
Having spent most of the year jiggling around with immense Lux-
O-Valves and Refracto-Nullifiers and Spectrum-Bypass-O-Matics, he
realized, with nine hours to go, that he wasn't going to make it.
So, he and his friends, and his friends' friends, and his
friends' friends' friends, and his friends' friends' friends'
friends, and some rather less good friends of theirs who happened
to own a major stellar trucking company, put in what now is
widely recognized as being the hardest night's work in history,
and, sure enough, on the following day, Magramal was no longer
visible. Effrafax lost his bet - and therefore his life - simply
because some pedantic adjudicating official noticed (a) that when
walking around the area that Magramal ought to be he didn't trip
over or break his nose on anything, and (b) a suspicious-looking
extra moon.
The Somebody Else's Problem field is much simpler and more
effective, and what's more can be run for over a hundred years on
a single torch battery. This is because it relies on people's
natural disposition not to see anything they don't want to,
weren't expecting, or can't explain. If Effrafax had painted the
mountain pink and erected a cheap and simple Somebody Else's
Problem field on it, then people would have walked past the
mountain, round it, even over it, and simply never have noticed
that the thing was there.
And this is precisely what was happening with Slartibartfast's
ship. It wasn't pink, but if it had been, that would have been
the least of its visual problems and people were simply ignoring
it like anything.
The most extraordinary thing about it was that it looked only
partly like a spaceship with guidance fins, rocket engines and
escape hatches and so on, and a great deal like a small upended
Italian bistro.
Ford and Arthur gazed up at it with wonderment and deeply
offended sensibilities.
"Yes, I know," said Slartibartfast, hurrying up to them at that
point, breathless and agitated, "but there is a reason. Come, we
must go. The ancient nightmare is come again. Doom confronts us
all. We must leave at once."
"I fancy somewhere sunny," said Ford.
Ford and Arthur followed Slartibartfast into the ship and were so
perplexed by what they saw inside it that they were totally
unaware of what happened next outside.
A spaceship, yet another one, but this one sleek and silver,
descended from the sky on to the pitch, quietly, without fuss,
its long legs unlocking in a smooth ballet of technology.
It landed gently. It extended a short ramp. A tall grey-green
figure marched briskly out and approached the small knot of
people who were gathered in the centre of the pitch tending to
the casualties of the recent bizarre massacre. It moved people
aside with quiet, understated authority, and came at last to a
man lying in a desperate pool of blood, clearly now beyond the
reach of any Earthly medicine, breathing, coughing his last. The
figure knelt down quietly beside him.
"Arthur Philip Deodat?" asked the figure.
The man, with horrified confusion in eyes, nodded feebly.
"You're a no-good dumbo nothing," whispered the creature. "I
thought you should know that before you went."
Important facts from Galactic history, number two:
(Reproduced from the Siderial Daily Mentioner's Book of popular
Galactic History.)
Since this Galaxy began, vast civilizations have risen and
fallen, risen and fallen, risen and fallen so often that it's
quite tempting to think that life in the Galaxy must be
(a) something akin to seasick - space-sick, time sick, history
sick or some such thing, and
(b) stupid.
It seemed to Arthur as if the whole sky suddenly just stood aside
and let them through.
It seemed to him that the atoms of his brain and the atoms of the
cosmos were streaming through each other.
It seemed to him that he was blown on the wind of the Universe,
and that the wind was him.
It seemed to him that he was one of the thoughts of the Universe
and that the Universe was a thought of his.
It seemed to the people at Lord's Cricket Ground that another
North London restaurant had just come and gone as they so often
do, and that this was Somebody Else's Problem.
"What happened?" whispered Arthur in considerable awe.
"We took off," said Slartibartfast.
Arthur lay in startled stillness on the acceleration couch. He
wasn't certain whether he had just got space-sickness or
religion.
"Nice mover," said Ford in an unsuccessful attempt to disguise
the degree to which he had been impressed by what
Slartibartfast's ship had just done, "shame about the decor."
For a moment or two the old man didn't reply. He was staring at
the instruments with the air of one who is trying to convert
fahrenheit to centigrade in his head whilst his house is burning
down. Then his brow cleared and he stared for a moment at the
wide panoramic screen in front of him, which displayed a
bewildering complexity of stars streaming like silver threads
around them.
His lips moved as if he was trying to spell something. Suddenly
his eyes darted in alarm back to his instruments, but then his
expression merely subsided into a steady frown. He looked back up
at the screen. He felt his own pulse. His frown deepened for a
moment, then he relaxed.
"It's a mistake to try and understand mathematics," he said,
"they only worry me. What did you say?"
"Decor," said Ford. "Pity about it."
"Deep in the fundamental heart of mind and Universe," said
Slartibartfast, "there is a reason."
Ford glanced sharply around. He clearly thought this was taking
an optimistic view of things.
The interior of the flight deck was dark green, dark red, dark
brown, cramped and moodily lit. Inexplicably, the resemblance to
a small Italian bistro had failed to end at the hatchway. Small
pools of light picked out pot plants, glazed tiles and all sorts
of little unidentifiable brass things.
Rafia-wrapped bottles lurked hideously in the shadows.
The instruments which had occupied Slartibartfast's attention
seemed to be mounted in the bottom of bottles which were set in
concrete.
Ford reached out and touched it.
Fake concrete. Plastic. Fake bottles set in fake concrete.
The fundamental heart of mind and Universe can take a running
jump, he thought to himself, this is rubbish. On the other hand,
it could not be denied that the way the ship had moved made the
Heart of Gold seem like an electric pram.
He swung himself off the couch. He brushed himself down. He
looked at Arthur who was singing quietly to himself. He looked at
the screen and recognized nothing. He looked at Slartibartfast.
"How far did we just travel?" he said.
"About ..." said Slartibartfast, "about two thirds of the way
across the Galactic disc, I would say, roughly. Yes, roughly two
thirds, I think."
"It's a strange thing," said Arthur quietly, "that the further
and faster one travels across the Universe, the more one's
position in it seems to be largely immaterial, and one is filled
with a profound, or rather emptied of a ..."
"Yes, very strange," said Ford. "Where are we going?"
"We are going," said Slartibartfast, "to confront an ancient
nightmare of the Universe."
"And where are you going to drop us off?"
"I will need your help."
"Tough. Look, there's somewhere you can take us where we can have
fun, I'm trying to think of it, we can get drunk and maybe listen
to some extremely evil music. Hold on, I'll look it up." He dug
out his copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and tipped
through those parts of the index primarily concerned with sex and
drugs and rock and roll.
"A curse has arisen from the mists of time," said Slartibartfast.
"Yes, I expect so," said Ford. "Hey," he said, lighting
accidentally on one particular reference entry, "Eccentrica
Gallumbits, did you ever meet her? The triple-breasted whore of
Eroticon Six. Some people say her erogenous zones start some four
miles from her actual body. Me, I disagree, I say five."
"A curse," said Slartibartfast, "which will engulf the Galaxy in
fire and destruction, and possibly bring the Universe to a
premature doom. I mean it," he added.
"Sounds like a bad time," said Ford, "with look I'll be drunk
enough not to notice. Here," he said, stabbing his finger at the
screen of the Guide, "would be a really wicked place to go, and I
think we should. What do you say, Arthur? Stop mumbling mantras
and pay attention. There's important stuff you're missing here."
Arthur pushed himself up from his couch and shook his head.
"Where are we going?" he said.
"To confront an ancient night-"
"Can it," said Ford. "Arthur, we are going out into the Galaxy to
have some fun. Is that an idea you can cope with?"
"What's Slartibartfast looking so anxious about?" said Arthur.
"Nothing," said Ford.
"Doom," said Slartibartfast. "Come," he added, with sudden
authority, "there is much I must show and tell you."
He walked towards a green wrought-iron spiral staircase set
incomprehensibly in the middle of the flight deck and started to
ascend. Arthur, with a frown, followed.
Ford slung the Guide sullenly back into his satchel.
"My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a
natural deficiency in moral fibre," he muttered to himself, "and
that I am therefore excused from saving Universes."
Nevertheless, he stomped up the stairs behind them.
What they found upstairs was just stupid, or so it seemed, and
Ford shook his head, buried his face in his hands and slumped
against a pot plant, crushing it against the wall.
"The central computational area," said Slartibartfast
unperturbed, "this is where every calculation affecting the ship
in any way is performed. Yes I know what it looks like, but it is
in fact a complex four-dimensional topographical map of a series
of highly complex mathematical functions."
"It looks like a joke," said Arthur.
"I know what it looks like," said Slartibartfast, and went into
it. As he did so, Arthur had a sudden vague flash of what it
might mean, but he refused to believe it. The Universe could not
possibly work like that, he thought, cannot possibly. That, he
thought to himself, would be as absurd as ... he terminated that
line of thinking. Most of the really absurd things he could think
of had already happened.
And this was one of them.
It was a large glass cage, or box - in fact a room.
In it was a table, a long one. Around it were gathered about a
dozen chairs, of the bentwood style. On it was a tablecloth - a
grubby, red and white check tablecloth, scarred with the
occasional cigarette burn, each, presumably, at a precise
calculated mathematical position.
And on the tablecloth sat some half-eaten Italian meals, hedged
about with half-eaten breadsticks and half-drunk glasses of wine,
and toyed with listlessly by robots.
It was all completely artificial. The robot customers were
attended by a robot waiter, a robot wine waiter and a robot
maetre d'. The furniture was artificial, the tablecloth
artificial, and each particular piece of food was clearly capable
of exhibiting all the mechanical characteristics of, say, a pollo
sorpreso, without actually being one.
And all participated in a little dance together - a complex
routine involving the manipulation of menus, bill pads, wallets,
cheque books, credit cards, watches, pencils and paper napkins,
which seemed to be hovering constantly on the edge of violence,
but never actually getting anywhere.
Slartibartfast hurried in, and then appeared to pass the time of
day quite idly with the maetre d', whilst one of the customer
robots, an autorory, slid slowly under the table, mentioning what
he intended to do to some guy over some girl.
Slartibartfast took over the seat which had been thus vacated and
passed a shrewd eye over the menu. The tempo of the routine round
the table seemed somehow imperceptibly to quicken. Arguments
broke out, people attempted to prove things on napkins. They
waved fiercely at each other, and attempted to examine each
other's pieces of chicken. The waiter's hand began to move on the
bill pad more quickly than a human hand could manage, and then
more quickly than a human eye could follow. The pace accelerated.
Soon, an extraordinary and insistent politeness overwhelmed the
group, and seconds later it seemed that a moment of consensus was
suddenly achieved. A new vibration thrilled through the ship.
Slartibartfast emerged from the glass room.
"Bistromathics," he said. "The most powerful computational force
known to parascience. Come to the Room of Informational
Illusions."
He swept past and carried them bewildered in his wake.
The Bistromatic Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing vast
interstellar distances without all that dangerous mucking about
with Improbability Factors.
Bistromathics itself is simply a revolutionary new way of
understanding the behaviour of numbers. Just as Einstein observed
that time was not an absolute but depended on the observer's
movement in space, and that space was not an absolute, but
depended on the observer's movement in time, so it is now
realized that numbers are not absolute, but depend on the
observer's movement in restaurants.
The first non-absolute number is the number of people for whom
the table is reserved. This will vary during the course of the
first three telephone calls to the restaurant, and then bear no
apparent relation to the number of people who actually turn up,
or to the number of people who subsequently join them after the
show match party gig, or to the number of people who leave when
they see who else has turned up.
The second non-absolute number is the given time of arrival,
which is now known to be one of those most bizarre of
mathematical concepts, a recipriversexcluson, a number whose
existence can only be defined as being anything other than
itself. In other words, the given time of arrival is the one
moment of time at which it is impossible that any member of the
party will arrive. Recipriversexclusons now play a vital part in
many branches of maths, including statistics and accountancy and
also form the basic equations used to engineer the Somebody
Else's Problem field.
The third and most mysterious piece of non-absoluteness of all
lies in the relationship between the number of items on the bill,
the cost of each item, the number of people at the table, and
what they are each prepared to pay for. (The number of people who
have actually brought any money is only a sub-phenomenon in this
field.)
The baffling discrepancies which used to occur at this point
remained uninvestigated for centuries simply because no one took
them seriously. They were at the time put down to such things as
politeness, rudeness, meanness, flashness, tiredness,
emotionality, or the lateness of the hour, and completely
forgotten about on the following morning. They were never tested
under laboratory conditions, of course, because they never
occurred in laboratories - not in reputable laboratories at
least.
And so it was only with the advent of pocket computers that the
startling truth became finally apparent, and it was this:
Numbers written on restaurant bills within the confines of
restaurants do not follow the same mathematical laws as numbers
written on any other pieces of paper in any other parts of the
Universe.
This single fact took the scientific world by storm. It
completely revolutionized it. So many mathematical conferences
got held in such good restaurants that many of the finest minds
of a generation died of obesity and heart failure and the science
of maths was put back by years.
Slowly, however, the implications of the idea began to be
understood. To begin with it had been too stark, too crazy, too
much what the man in the street would have said, "Oh yes, I could
have told you that," about. Then some phrases like "Interactive
Subjectivity Frameworks" were invented, and everybody was able to
relax and get on with it.
The small groups of monks who had taken up hanging around the
major research institutes singing strange chants to the effect
that the Universe was only a figment of its own imagination were
eventually given a street theatre grant and went away.
"In space travel, you see," said Slartibartfast, as he fiddled
with some instruments in the Room of Informational Illusions, "in
space travel ..."
He stopped and looked about him.
The Room of Informational Illusions was a welcome relief after
the visual monstrosities of the central computational area. There
was nothing in it. No information, no illusions, just themselves,
white walls and a few small instruments which looked as if they
were meant to plug into something which Slartibartfast couldn't
find.
"Yes?" urged Arthur. He had picked up Slartibartfast's sense of
urgency but didn't know what to do with it.
"Yes what?" said the old man.
"You were saying?"
Slartibartfast looked at him sharply.
"The numbers," he said, "are awful." He resumed his search.
Arthur nodded wisely to himself. After a while he realized that
this wasn't getting him anywhere and decided that he would say
"what?" after all.
"In space travel," repeated Slartibartfast, "all the numbers are
awful."
Arthur nodded again and looked round to Ford for help, but Ford
was practising being sullen and getting quite good at it.
"I was only," said Slartibartfast with a sigh, "trying to save
you the trouble of asking me why all the ship's computations were
being done on a waiter's bill pad."
Arthur frowned.
"Why," he said, "were all the ship's computations being done on a
wait-"
He stopped.
Slartibartfast said, "Because in space travel all the numbers are
awful."
He could tell that he wasn't getting his point across.
"Listen," he said. "On a waiter's bill pad numbers dance. You
must have encountered the phenomenon."
"Well ..."
"On a waiter's bill pad," said Slartibartfast, "reality and
unreality collide on such a fundamental level that each becomes
the other and anything is possible, within certain parameters."
"What parameters?"
"It's impossible to say," said Slartibartfast. "That's one of
them. Strange but true. At least, I think it's strange," he
added, "and I'm assured that it's true."
At that moment he located the slot in the wall for which he had
been searching, and clicked the instrument he was holding into
it.
"Do not be alarmed," he said, and then suddenly darted an alarmed
look at himself, and lunged back, "it's ..."
They didn't hear what he said, because at that moment the ship
winked out of existence around them and a starbattle-ship the
size of a small Midlands industrial city plunged out of the
sundered night towards them, star lasers ablaze.
They gaped, pop-eyed, and were unable to scream.
Another world, another day, another dawn.
The early morning's thinnest sliver of light appeared silently.
Several billion trillion tons of superhot exploding hydrogen
nuclei rose slowly above the horizon and managed to look small,
cold and slightly damp.
There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there is the
possibility of magic. Creation holds its breath.
The moment passed as it regularly did on Squornshellous Zeta,
without incident.
The mist clung to the surface of the marshes. The swamp trees
were grey with it, the tall reeds indistinct. It hung motionless
like held breath.
Nothing moved.
There was silence.
The sun struggled feebly with the mist, tried to impart a little
warmth here, shed a little light there, but clearly today was
going to be just another long haul across the sky.
Nothing moved.
Again, silence.
Nothing moved.
Silence.
Very often on Squornshellous Zeta, whole days would go on like
this, and this was indeed going to be one of them.
Fourteen hours later the sun sank hopelessly beneath the opposite
horizon with a sense of totally wasted effort.
And a few hours later it reappeared, squared its shoulders and
started on up the sky again.
This time, however, something was happening. A mattress had just
met a robot.
"Hello, robot," said the mattress.
"Bleah," said the robot and continued what it was doing, which
was walking round very slowly in a very tiny circle.
"Happy?" said the mattress.
The robot stopped and looked at the mattress. It looked at it
quizzically. It was clearly a very stupid mattress. It looked
back at him with wide eyes.
After what it had calculated to ten significant decimal places as
being the precise length of pause most likely to convey a general
contempt for all things mattressy, the robot continued to walk
round in tight circles.
"We could have a conversation," said the mattress, "would you
like that?"
It was a large mattress, and probably one of quite high quality.
Very few things actually get manufactured these days, because in
an infinitely large Universe such as, for instance, the one in
which we live, most things one could possibly imagine, and a lot
of things one would rather not, grow somewhere. A forest was
discovered recently in which most of the trees grew ratchet
screwdrivers as fruit. The life cycle of ratchet screwdriver
fruit it quite interesting. Once picked it needs a dark dusty
drawer in which it can lie undisturbed for years. Then one night
it suddenly hatches, discards its outer skin which crumbles into
dust, and emerges as a totally unidentifiable little metal object
with flanges at both ends and a sort of ridge and a sort of hole
for a screw. This, when found, will get thrown away. No one knows
what it is supposed to gain from this. Nature, in her infinite
wisdom, is presumably working on it.
No one really knows what mattresses are meant to gain from their
lives either. They are large, friendly, pocket-sprung creatures
which live quiet private lives in the marshes of Squornshellous
Zeta. Many of them get caught, slaughtered, dried out, shipped
out and slept on. None of them seem to mind and all of them are
called Zem.
"No," said Marvin.
"My name," said the mattress, "is Zem. We could discuss the
weather a little."
Marvin paused again in his weary circular plod.
"The dew," he observed, "has clearly fallen with a particularly
sickening thud this morning."
He resumed his walk, as if inspired by this conversational
outburst to fresh heights of gloom and despondency. He plodded
tenaciously. If he had had teeth he would have gritted them at
this point. He hadn't. He didn't. The mere plod said it all.
The mattress flolloped around. This is a thing that only live
mattresses in swamps are able to do, which is why the word is not
in more common usage. It flolloped in a sympathetic sort of way,
moving a fairish body of water as it did so. It blew a few
bubbles up through the water engagingly. Its blue and white
stripes glistened briefly in a sudden feeble ray of sun that had
unexpectedly made it through the mist, causing the creature to
bask momentarily.
Marvin plodded.
"You have something on your mind, I think," said the mattress
floopily.
"More than you can possibly imagine," dreaded Marvin. "My
capacity for mental activity of all kinds is as boundless as the
infinite reaches of space itself. Except of course for my
capacity for happiness."
Stomp, stomp, he went.
"My capacity for happiness," he added, "you could fit into a
matchbox without taking out the matches first."
The mattress globbered. This is the noise made by a live, swamp-
dwelling mattress that is deeply moved by a story of personal
tragedy. The word can also, according to The Ultra-Complete
Maximegalon Dictionary of Every Language Ever, mean the noise
made by the Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop on discovering that he
has forgotten his wife's birthday for the second year running.
Since there was only ever one Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop, and
he never married, the word is only ever used in a negative or
speculative sense, and there is an ever-increasing body of
opinion which holds that The Ultra-Complete Maximegalon
Dictionary is not worth the fleet of lorries it takes to cart its
microstored edition around in. Strangely enough, the dictionary
omits the word "floopily", which simply means "in the manner of
something which is floopy".
The mattress globbered again.
"I sense a deep dejection in your diodes," it vollued (for the
meaning of the word "vollue", buy a copy of Squornshellous
Swamptalk at any remaindered bookshop, or alternatively buy The
Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary, as the University will be
very glad to get it off their hands and regain some valuable
parking lots), "and it saddens me. You should be more
mattresslike. We live quiet retired lives in the swamp, where we
are content to flollop and vollue and regard the wetness in a
fairly floopy manner. Some of us are killed, but all of us are
called Zem, so we never know which and globbering is thus kept to
a minimum. Why are you walking in circles?"
"Because my leg is stuck," said Marvin simply.
"It seems to me," said the mattress eyeing it compassionately,
"that it is a pretty poor sort of leg."
"You are right," said Marvin, "it is."
"Voon," said the mattress.
"I expect so," said Marvin, "and I also expect that you find the
idea of a robot with an artificial leg pretty amusing. You should
tell your friends Zem and Zem when you see them later; they'll
laugh, if I know them, which I don't of course - except insofar
as I know all organic life forms, which is much better than I
would wish to. Ha, but my life is but a box of wormgears."
He stomped around again in his tiny circle, around his thin steel
peg-leg which revolved in the mud but seemed otherwise stuck.
"But why do you just keep walking round and round?" said the
mattress.
"Just to make the point," said Marvin, and continued, round and
round.
"Consider it made, my dear friend," flurbled the mattress,
"consider it made."
"Just another million years," said Marvin, "just another quick
million. Then I might try it backwards. Just for the variety, you
understand."
The mattress could feel deep in his innermost spring pockets that
the robot dearly wished to be asked how long he had been trudging
in this futile and fruitless manner, and with another quiet
flurble he did so.
"Oh, just over the one-point-five-million mark, just over," said
Marvin airily. "Ask me if I ever get bored, go on, ask me."
The mattress did.
Marvin ignored the question, he merely trudged with added
emphasis.
"I gave a speech once," he said suddenly, and apparently
unconnectedly. "You may not instantly see why I bring the subject
up, but that is because my mind works so phenomenally fast, and I
am at a rough estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than
you. Let me give you an example. Think of a number, any number."
"Er, five," said the mattress.
"Wrong," said Marvin. "You see?"
The mattress was much impressed by this and realized that it was
in the presence of a not unremarkable mind. It willomied along
its entire length, sending excited little ripples through its
shallow algae-covered pool.
It gupped.
"Tell me," it urged, "of the speech you once made, I long to hear
it."
"It was received very badly," said Marvin, "for a variety of
reasons. I delivered it," he added, pausing to make an awkward
humping sort of gesture with his not-exactly-good arm, but his
arm which was better than the other one which was dishearteningly
welded to his left side, "over there, about a mile distance."
He was pointing as well as he could manage, and he obviously
wanted to make it totally clear that this was as well as he could
manage, through the mist, over the reeds, to a part of the marsh
which looked exactly the same as every other part of the marsh.
"There," he repeated. "I was somewhat of a celebrity at the
time."
Excitement gripped the mattress. It had never heard of speeches
being delivered on Squornshellous Zeta, and certainly not by
celebrities. Water spattered off it as a thrill glurried across
its back.
It did something which mattresses very rarely bother to do.
Summoning every bit of its strength, it reared its oblong body,
heaved it up into the air and held it quivering there for a few
seconds whilst it peered through the mist over the reeds at the
part of the marsh which Marvin had indicated, observing, without
disappointment, that it was exactly the same as every other part
of the marsh. The effort was too much, and it flodged back into
its pool, deluging Marvin with smelly mud, moss and weeds.
"I was a celebrity," droned the robot sadly, "for a short while
on account of my miraculous and bitterly resented escape from a
fate almost as good as death in the heart of a blazing sun. You
can guess from my condition," he added, "how narrow my escape
was. I was rescued by a scrap-metal merchant, imagine that. Here
I am, brain the size of ... never mind."
He trudged savagely for a few seconds.
"He it was who fixed me up with this leg. Hateful, isn't it? He
sold me to a Mind Zoo. I was the star exhibit. I had to sit on a
box and tell my story whilst people told me to cheer up and think
positive. Give us a grin, little robot,' they would shout at me,
give us a little chuckle.' I would explain to them that to get
my face to grin wold take a good couple of hours in a workshop
with a wrench, and that went down very well."
"The speech," urged the mattress. "I long to hear of the speech
you gave in the marshes."
"There was a bridge built across the marshes. A cyberstructured
hyperbridge, hundreds of miles in length, to carry ion-buggies
and freighters over the swamp."
"A bridge?" quirruled the mattress. "Here in the swamp?"
"A bridge," confirmed Marvin, "here in the swamp. It was going to
revitalize the economy of the Squornshellous System. They spent
the entire economy of the Squornshellous System building it. They
asked me to open it. Poor fools."
It began to rain a little, a fine spray slid through the mist.
"I stood on the platform. For hundreds of miles in front of me,
and hundreds of miles behind me, the bridge stretched."
"Did it glitter?" enthused the mattress.
"It glittered."
"Did it span the miles majestically?"
"It spanned the miles majestically."
"Did it stretch like a silver thread far out into the invisible
mist?"
"Yes," said Marvin. "Do you want to hear this story?"
"I want to hear your speech," said the mattress.
"This is what I said. I said, I would like to say that it is a
very great pleasure, honour and privilege for me to open this
bridge, but I can't because my lying circuits are all out of
commission. I hate and despise you all. I now declare this
hapless cyberstructure open to the unthinkable abuse of all who
wantonly cross her.' And I plugged myself into the opening
circuits."
Marvin paused, remembering the moment.
The mattress flurred and glurried. It flolloped, gupped and
willomied, doing this last in a particularly floopy way.
"Voon," it wurfed at last. "And it was a magnificent occasion?"
"Reasonably magnificent. The entire thousand-mile-long bridge
spontaneously folded up its glittering spans and sank weeping
into the mire, taking everybody with it."
There was a sad and terrible pause at this point in the
conversation during which a hundred thousand people seemed
unexpectedly to say "wop" and a team of white robots descended
from the sky like dandelion seeds drifting on the wind in tight
military formation. For a sudden violent moment they were all
there, in the swamp, wrenching Marvin's false leg off, and then
they were gone again in their ship, which said "foop".
"You see the sort of thing I have to contend with?" said Marvin
to the gobbering mattress.
Suddenly, a moment later, the robots were back again for another
violent incident, and this time when they left, the mattress was
alone in the swamp. He flolloped around in astonishment and
alarm. He almost lurgled in fear. He reared himself to see over
the reeds, but there was nothing to see, just more reeds. He
listened, but there was no sound on the wind beyond the now
familiar sound of half-crazed etymologists calling distantly to
each other across the sullen mire.
The body of Arthur Dent span.
The Universe shattered into a million glittering fragments around
it, and each particular shard span silently through the void,
reflecting on its silver surface some single searing holocaust of
fire and destruction.
And then the blackness behind the Universe exploded, and each
particular piece of blackness was the furious smoke of hell.
And the nothingness behind the blackness behind the Universe
erupted, and behind the nothingness behind the blackness behind
the shattered Universe was at last the dark figure of an immense
man speaking immense words.
"These, then," said the figure, speaking from an immensely
comfortable chair, "were the Krikkit Wars, the greatest
devastation ever visited upon our Galaxy. What you have
experienced ..."
Slartibartfast floated past, waving.
"It's just a documentary," he called out. "This is not a good
bit. Terribly sorry, trying to find the rewind control ..."
"... is what billions of billions of innocent ..."
"Do not," called out Slartibartfast floating past again, and
fiddling furiously with the thing that he had stuck into the wall
of the Room of Informational Illusions and which was in fact
still stuck there, "agree to buy anything at this point."
"... people, creatures, your fellow beings ..."
Music swelled - again, it was immense music, immense chords. And
behind the man, slowly, three tall pillars began to emerge out of
the immensely swirling mist.
"... experienced, lived through - or, more often, failed to live
through. Think of that, my friends. And let us not forget - and
in just a moment I shall be able to suggest a way which will help
us always to remember - that before the Krikkit Wars, the Galaxy
was that rare and wonderful thing a happy Galaxy!"
The music was going bananas with immensity at this point.
"A Happy Galaxy, my friends, as represented by the symbol of the
Wikkit Gate!"
The three pillars stood out clearly now, three pillars topped
with two cross pieces in a way which looked stupefyingly familiar
to Arthur's addled brain.
"The three pillars," thundered the man. "The Steel Pillar which
represented the Strength and Power of the Galaxy!"
Searchlights seared out and danced crazy dances up and down the
pillar on the left which was, clearly, made of steel or something
very like it. The music thumped and bellowed.
"The Perspex Pillar," announced the man, "representing the forces
of Science and Reason in the Galaxy!"
Other searchlights played exotically up and down the righthand,
transparent pillar creating dazzling patterns within it and a
sudden inexplicable craving for ice-cream in the stomach of
Arthur Dent.
"And," the thunderous voice continued, "the Wooden Pillar,
representing ..." and here his voice became just very slightly
hoarse with wonderful sentiments, "the forces of Nature and
Spirituality."
The lights picked out the central pillar. The music moved bravely
up into the realms of complete unspeakability.
"Between them supporting," the voice rolled on, approaching its
climax, "the Golden Bail of Prosperity and the Silver Bail of
Peace!"
The whole structure was now flooded with dazzling lights, and the
music had now, fortunately, gone far beyond the limits of the
discernible. At the top of the three pillars the two brilliantly
gleaming bails sat and dazzled. There seemed to be girls sitting
on top of them, or maybe they were meant to be angels. Angels are
usually represented as wearing more than that, though.
Suddenly there was a dramatic hush in what was presumably meant
to be the Cosmos, and a darkening of the lights.
"There is not a world," thrilled the man's expert voice, "not a
civilized world in the Galaxy where this symbol is not revered
even today. Even in primitive worlds it persists in racial
memories. This it was that the forces of Krikkit destroyed, and
this it is that now locks their world away till the end of
eternity!"
And with a flourish, the man produced in his hands a model of the
Wikkit gate. Scale was terribly hard to judge in this whole
extraordinary spectacle, but the model looked as if it must have
been about three feet high.
"Not the original key, of course. That, as everyone knows, was
destroyed, blasted into the ever-whirling eddies of the space-
time continuum and lost for ever. This is a remarkable replica,
hand-tooled by skilled craftsmen, lovingly assembled using
ancient craft secrets into a memento you will be proud to own, in
memory of those who fell, and in tribute to the Galaxy - our
Galaxy - which they died to defend ..."
Slartibartfast floated past again at this moment.
"Found it," he said. "We can lose all this rubbish. Just don't
nod, that's all."
"Now, let us bow our heads in payment," intoned the voice, and
then said it again, much faster and backwards.
Lights came and went, the pillars disappeared, the man gabled
himself backwards into nothing, the Universe snappily reassembled
itself around them.
"You get the gist?" said Slartibartfast.
"I'm astonished," said Arthur, "and bewildered."
"I was asleep," said Ford, who floated into view at this point.
"Did I miss anything?"
They found themselves once again teetering rather rapidly on the
edge of an agonizingly high cliff. The wind whipped out from
their faces and across a bay on which the remains of one of the
greatest and most powerful space battle-fleets ever assembled in
the Galaxy was briskly burning itself back into existence. The
sky was a sullen pink, darkening via a rather curious colour to
blue and upwards to black. Smoke billowed down out of it at an
incredible lick.
Events were now passing back by them almost too quickly to be
distinguished, and when, a short while later, a huge starbattle-
ship rushed away from them as if they'd said "boo", they only
just recognized it as the point at which they had come in.
But now things were too rapid, a video-tactile blur which brushed
and jiggled them through centuries of galactic history, turning,
twisting, flickering. The sound was a mere thin thrill.
Periodically through the thickening jumble of events they sensed
appalling catastrophes, deep horrors, cataclysmic shocks, and
these were always associated with certain recurring images, the
only images which ever stood out clearly from the avalance of
tumbling history: a wicket gate, a small hard red ball, hard
white robots, and also something less distinct, something dark
and cloudy.
But there was also another sensation which rose clearly out of
the thrilling passage of time.
Just as a slow series of clicks when speeded up will lose the
definition of each individual click and gradually take on the
quality of a sustained and rising tone, so a series of individual
impressions here took on the quality of a sustained emotion - and
yet not an emotion. If it was an emotion, it was a totally
emotionless one. It was hatred, implacable hatred. It was cold,
not like ice is cold, but like a wall is cold. It was impersonal,
not as a randomly flung fist in a crowd is impersonal, but like a
computer-issued parking summons is impersonal. And it was deadly
- again, not like a bullet or a knife is deadly, but like a brick
wall across a motorway is deadly.
And just as a rising tone will change in character and take on
harmonics as it rises, so again, this emotionless emotion seemed
to rise to an unbearable if unheard scream and suddenly seemed to
be a scream of guilt and failure.
And suddenly it stopped.
They were left standing on a quiet hilltop on a tranquil evening.
The sun was setting.
All around them softly undulating green countryside rolled off
gently into the distance. Birds sang about what they thought of
it all, and the general opinion seemed to be good. A little way
away could be heard the sound of children playing, and a little
further away than the apparent source of that sound could be seen
in the dimming evening light the outlines of a small town.
The town appeared to consist mostly of fairly low buildings made
of white stone. The skyline was of gentle pleasing curves.
The sun had nearly set.
As if out of nowhere, music began. Slartibartfast tugged at a
switch and it stopped.
A voice said, "This ..." Slartibartfast tugged at a switch and it
stopped.
"I will tell you about it," he said quietly.
The place was peaceful. Arthur felt happy. Even Ford seemed
cheerful. They walked a short way in the direction of the town,
and the Informational Illusion of the grass was pleasant and
springy under their feet, and the Informational Illusion of the
flowers smelt sweet and fragrant. Only Slartibartfast seemed
apprehensive and out of sorts.
He stopped and looked up.
It suddenly occurred to Arthur that, coming as this did at the
end, so to speak, or rather the beginning of all the horror they
had just blurredly experienced, something nasty must be about to
happen. He was distressed to think that something nasty could
happen to somewhere as idyllic as this. He too glanced up. There
was nothing in the sky.
"They're not about to attack here, are they?" he said. He
realized that this was merely a recording he was walking through,
but he still felt alarmed.
"Nothing is about to attack here," said Slartibartfast in a voice
which unexpectedly trembled with emotion. "This is where it all
started. This is the place itself. This is Krikkit."
He stared up into the sky.
The sky, from one horizon to another, from east to west, from
north to south, was utterly and completely black.
Stomp stomp.
Whirrr.
"Pleased to be of service."
"Shut up."
"Thank you."
Stomp stomp stomp stomp stomp.
Whirrr.
"Thank you for making a simple door very happy."
"Hope your diodes rot."
"Thank you. Have a nice day."
Stomp stomp stomp stomp.
Whirrr.
"It is my pleasure to open for you ..."
"Zark off."
"... and my satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a
job well done."
"I said zark off."
"Thank you for listening to this message."
Stomp stomp stomp stomp.
"Wop."
Zaphod stopped stomping. He had been stomping around the Heart of
Gold for days, and so far no door had said "wop" to him. He was
fairly certain that no door had said "wop" to him now. It was not
the sort of thing doors said. Too concise. Furthermore, there
were not enough doors. It sounded as if a hundred thousand people
had said "wop", which puzzled him because he was the only person
on the ship.
It was dark. Most of the ship's non-essential systems were closed
down. It was drifting in a remote area of the Galaxy, deep in the
inky blackness of space. So which particular hundred thousand
people would turn up at this point and say a totally unexpected
"wop"?
He looked about him, up the corridor and down the corridor. It
was all in deep shadow. There were just the very dim pinkish
outlines of the doors which glowed in the dark and pulsed
whenever they spoke, though he had tried every way he could think
of of stopping them.
The lights were off so that his heads could avoid looking at each
other, because neither of them was currently a particularly
engaging sight, and nor had they been since he had made the error
of looking into his soul.
It had indeed been an error. It had been late one night - of
course.
It had been a difficult day - of course.
There had been soulful music playing on the ship's sound system -
of course.
And he had, of course, been slightly drunk.
In other words, all the usual conditions which bring on a bout of
soul-searching had applied, but it had, nevertheless, clearly
been an error.
Standing now, silent and alone in the dark corridor he remembered
the moment and shivered. His one head looked one way and his
other the other and each decided that the other was the way to
go.
He listened but could hear nothing.
All there had been was the "wop".
It seemed an awfully long way to bring an awfully large number of
people just to say one word.
He started nervously to edge his way in the direction of the
bridge. There at least he would feel in control. He stopped
again. The way he was feeling he didn't think he was an awfully
good person to be in control.
The first shock of that moment, thinking back, had been
discovering that he actually had a soul.
In fact he'd always more or less assumed that he had one as he
had a full complement of everything else, and indeed two of
somethings, but suddenly actually to encounter the thing lurking
there deep within him had giving him a severe jolt.
And then to discover (this was the second shock) that it wasn't
the totally wonderful object which he felt a man in his position
had a natural right to expect had jolted him again.
Then he had thought about what his position actually was and the
renewed shock had nearly made him spill his drink. He drained it
quickly before anything serious happened to it. He then had
another quick one to follow the first one down and check that it
was all right.
"Freedom," he said aloud.
Trillian came on to the bridge at that point and said several
enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom.
"I can't cope with it," he said darkly, and sent a third drink
down to see why the second hadn't yet reported on the condition
of the first. He looked uncertainly at both of her and preferred
the one on the right.
He poured a drink down his other throat with the plan that it
would head the previous one off at the pass, join forces with it,
and together they would get the second to pull itself together.
Then all three would go off in search of the first, give it a
good talking to and maybe a bit of a sing as well.
He felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink had understood
all that, so he sent down a fifth to explain the plan more fully
and a sixth for moral support.
"You're drinking too much," said Trillian.
His heads collided trying to sort out the four of her he could
now see into a whole position. He gave up and looked at the
navigation screen and was astonished to see a quite phenomenal
number of stars.
"Excitement and adventure and really wild things," he muttered.
"Look," she said in a sympathetic tone of voice, and sat down
near him, "it's quite understandable that you're going to feel a
little aimless for a bit."
He boggled at her. He had never seen anyone sit on their own lap
before.
"Wow," he said. He had another drink.
"You've finished the mission you've been on for years."
"I haven't been on it. I've tried to avoid being on it."
"You've still finished it."
He grunted. There seemed to be a terrific party going on in his
stomach.
"I think it finished me," he said. "Here I am, Zaphod Beeblebrox,
I can go anywhere, do anything. I have the greatest ship in the
know sky, a girl with whom things seem to be working out pretty
well ..."
"Are they?"
"As far as I can tell I'm not an expert in personal relationships
..."
Trillian raised her eyebrows.
"I am," he added, "one hell of a guy, I can do anything I want
only I just don't have the faintest idea what."
He paused.
"One thing," he further added, "has suddenly ceased to lead to
another" - in contradiction of which he had another drink and
slid gracelessly off his chair.
Whilst he slept it off, Trillian did a little research in the
ship's copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It had some
advice to offer on drunkenness.
"Go to it," it said, "and good luck."
It was cross-referenced to the entry concerning the size of the
Universe and ways of coping with that.
Then she found the entry on Han Wavel, an exotic holiday planet,
and one of the wonders of the Galaxy.
Han Wavel is a world which consists largely of fabulous ultra-
luxury hotels and casinos, all of which have been formed by the
natural erosion of wind and rain.
The chances of this happening are more or less one to infinity
against. Little is known of how this came about because none of
the geophysicists, probability statisticians, meteoranalysts or
bizzarrologists who are so keen to research it can afford to stay
there.
Terrific, thought Trillian to herself, and within a few hours the
great white running-shoe ship was slowly powering down out of the
sky beneath a hot brilliant sun towards a brightly coloured sandy
spaceport. The ship was clearly causing a sensation on the
ground, and Trillian was enjoying herself. She heard Zaphod
moving around and whistling somewhere in the ship.
"How are you?" she said over the general intercom.
"Fine," he said brightly, "terribly well."
"Where are you?"
"In the bathroom."
"What are you doing?"
"Staying here."
After an hour or two it became plain that he meant it and the
ship returned to the sky without having once opened its hatchway.
"Heigh ho," said Eddie the Computer.
Trillian nodded patiently, tapped her fingers a couple of times
and pushed the intercom switch.
"I think that enforced fun is probably not what you need at this
point."
"Probably not," replied Zaphod from wherever he was.
"I think a bit of physical challenge would help draw you out of
yourself."
"Whatever you think, I think," said Zaphod.
"Recreational Impossibilities" was a heading which caught
Trillian's eye when, a short while later, she sat down to flip
through the Guide again, and as the Heart of Gold rushed at
improbable speeds in an indeterminate direction, she sipped a cup
of something undrinkable from the Nutrimatic Drink Dispenser and
read about how to fly.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say on the
subject of flying.
There is an art, it says, or rather a knack to flying.
The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground
and miss.
Pick a nice day, it suggests, and try it.
The first part is easy.
All it requires is simply the ability to throw yourself forward
with all your weight, and the willingness not to mind that it's
going to hurt.
That is, it's going to hurt if you fail to miss the ground.
Most people fail to miss the ground, and if they are really
trying properly, the likelihood is that they will fail to miss it
fairly hard.
Clearly, it's the second point, the missing, which presents the
difficulties.
One problem is that you have to miss the ground accidentally.
It's no good deliberately intending to miss the ground because
you won't. You have to have your attention suddenly distracted by
something else when you're halfway there, so that you are no
longer thinking about falling, or about the ground, or about how
much it's going to hurt if you fail to miss it.
It is notoriously difficult to prise your attention away from
these three things during the split second you have at your
disposal. Hence most people's failure, and their eventual
disillusionment with this exhilarating and spectacular sport.
If, however, you are lucky enough to have your attention
momentarily distracted at the crucial moment by, say, a gorgeous
pair of legs (tentacles, pseudopodia, according to phyllum and or
personal inclination) or a bomb going off in your vicinity, or by
suddenly spotting an extremely rare species of beetle crawling
along a nearby twig, then in your astonishment you will miss the
ground completely and remain bobbing just a few inches above it
in what might seem to be a slightly foolish manner.
This is a moment for superb and delicate concentration.
Bob and float, float and bob.
Ignore all considerations of your own weight and simply let
yourself waft higher.
Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because
they are unlikely to say anything helpful.
They are most likely to say something along the lines of, "Good
God, you can't possibly be flying!"
It is vitally important not to believe them or they will suddenly
be right.
Waft higher and higher.
Try a few swoops, gentle ones at first, then drift above the
treetops breathing regularly.
Do not wave at anybody.
When you have done this a few times you will find the moment of
distraction rapidly becomes easier and easier to achieve.
You will then learn all sorts of things about how to control your
flight, your speed, your manoeuvrability, and the trick usually
lies in not thinking too hard about whatever you want to do, but
just allowing it to happen as if it was going to anyway.
You will also learn how to land properly, which is something you
will almost certainly cock up, and cock up badly, on your first
attempt.
There are private flying clubs you can join which help you
achieve the all-important moment of distraction. They hire people
with surprising bodies or opinions to leap out from behind bushes
and exhibit and or explain them at the crucial moments. Few
genuine hitch-hikers will be able to afford to join these clubs,
but some may be able to get temporary employment at them.
Trillian read this longingly, but reluctantly decided that Zaphod
wasn't really in the right frame of mind for attempting to fly,
or for walking through mountains or for trying to get the
Brantisvogan Civil Service to acknowledge a change-of-address
card, which were the other things listed under the heading
"Recreational Impossibilities".
Instead, she flew the ship to Allosimanius Syneca, a world of
ice, snow, mind-hurtling beauty and stunning cold. The trek from
the snow plains of Liska to the summit of the Ice Crystal
Pyramids of Sastantua is long and gruelling, even with jet skis
and a team of Syneca Snowhounds, but the view from the top, a
view which takes in the Stin Glacier Fields, the shimmering Prism
Mountains and the far ethereal dancing icelights, is one which
first freezes the mind and then slowly releases it to hitherto
unexperienced horizons of beauty, and Trillian, for one, felt
that she could do with a bit of having her mind slowly released
to hitherto unexperienced horizons of beauty.
They went into a low orbit.
There lay the silverwhite beauty of Allosimanius Syneca beneath
them.
Zaphod stayed in bed with one head stuck under a pillow and the
other doing crosswords till late into the night.
Trillian nodded patiently again, counted to a sufficiently high
number, and told herself that the important thing now was just to
get Zaphod talking.
She prepared, by dint of deactivating all the robot kitchen
synthomatics, the most fabulously delicious meal she could
contrive - delicately oiled meals, scented fruits, fragrant
cheeses, fine Aldebaran wines.
She carried it through to him and asked if he felt like talking
things through.
"Zark off," said Zaphod.
Trillian nodded patiently to herself, counted to an even higher
number, tossed the tray lightly aside, walked to the transport
room and just teleported herself the hell out of his life.
She didn't even programme any coordinates, she hadn't the
faintest idea where she was going, she just went - a random row
of dots flowing through the Universe.
"Anything," she said to herself as she left, "is better than
this."
"Good job too," muttered Zaphod to himself, turned over and
failed to go to sleep.
The next day he restlessly paced the empty corridors of the ship,
pretending not to look for her, though he knew she wasn't there.
He ignored the computer's querulous demands to know just what the
hell was going on around here by fitting a small electronic gag
across a pair of its terminals.
After a while he began to turn down the lights. There was nothing
to see. Nothing was about to happen.
Lying in bed one night - and night was now virtually continuous
on the ship - he decided to pull himself together, to get things
into some kind of perspective. He sat up sharply and started to
pull clothes on. He decided that there must be someone in the
Universe feeling more wretched, miserable and forsaken than
himself, and he determined to set out and find him.
Halfway to the bridge it occurred to him that it might be Marvin,
and he returned to bed.
It was a few hours later than this, as he stomped disconsolately
about the darkened corridors swearing at cheerful doors, that he
heard the "wop" said, and it made him very nervous.
He leant tensely against the corridor wall and frowned like a man
trying to unbend a corkscrew by telekinesis. He laid his
fingertips against the wall and felt an unusual vibration. And
now he could quite clearly hear slight noises, and could hear
where they were coming from - they were coming from the bridge.
"Computer?" he hissed.
"Mmmm?" said the computer terminal nearest him, equally quietly.
"Is there someone on this ship?"
"Mmmmm," said the computer.
"Who is it?"
Mmmmm mmm mmmmm," said the computer.
"What?"
"Mmmmm mmmm mm mmmmmmmm."
Zaphod buried one of his faces in two of his hands.
"Oh, Zarquon," he muttered to himself. Then he stared up the
corridor towards the entrance to the bridge in the dim distance
from which more and purposeful noises were coming, and in which
the gagged terminals were situated.
"Computer," he hissed again.
"Mmmmm?"
"When I ungag you ..."
"Mmmmm."
"Remind me to punch myself in the mouth."
"Mmmmm mmm?"
"Either one. Now just tell me this. One for yes, two for no. Is
it dangerous?"
"Mmmmm."
"It is?"
"Mmmm."
"You didn't just go mmmm' twice?"
"Mmmm mmmm."
"Hmmmm."
He inched his way up the corridor as if he would rather be
yarding his way down it, which was true.
He was within two yards of the door to the bridge when he
suddenly realized to his horror that it was going to be nice to
him, and he stopped dead. He hadn't been able to turn off the
doors' courtesy voice circuits.
This doorway to the bridge was concealed from view within it
because of the excitingly chunky way in which the bridge had been
designed to curve round, and he had been hoping to enter
unobserved.
He leant despondently back against the wall again and said some
words which his other head was quite shocked to hear.
He peered at the dim pink outline of the door, and discovered
that in the darkness of the corridor he could just about make out
the Sensor Field which extended out into the corridor and told
the door when there was someone there for whom it must open and
to whom it must make a cheery and pleasant remark.
He pressed himself hard back against the wall and edged himself
towards the door, flattening his chest as much as he possibly
could to avoid brushing against the very, very dim perimeter of
the field. He held his breath, and congratulated himself on
having lain in bed sulking for the last few days rather than
trying to work out his feelings on chest expanders in the ship's
gym.
He then realized he was going to have to speak at this point.
He took a series of very shallow breaths, and then said as
quickly and as quietly as he could, "Door, if you can hear me,
say so very, very quietly."
Very, very quietly, the door murmured, "I can hear you."
"Good. Now, in a moment, I'm going to ask you to open. When you
open I do not want you to say that you enjoyed it, OK?"
"OK."
"And I don't want you to say to me that I have made a simple door
very happy, or that it is your pleasure to open for me and your
satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well
done, OK?"
"OK."
"And I do not want you to ask me to have a nice day, understand?"
"I understand."
"OK," said Zaphod, tensing himself, "open now."
The door slid open quietly. Zaphod slipped quietly through. The
door closed quietly behind him.
"Is that the way you like it, Mr Beeblebrox?" said the door out
loud.
"I want you to imagine," said Zaphod to the group of white robots
who swung round to stare at him at that point, "that I have an
extremely powerful Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in my hand."
There was an immensely cold and savage silence. The robots
regarded him with hideously dead eyes. They stood very still.
There was something intensely macabre about their appearance,
especially to Zaphod who had never seen one before or even known
anything about them. The Krikkit Wars belonged to the ancient
past of the Galaxy, and Zaphod had spent most of his early
history lessons plotting how he was going to have sex with the
girl in the cybercubicle next to him, and since his teaching
computer had been an integral part of this plot it had eventually
had all its history circuits wiped and replaced with an entirely
different set of ideas which had then resulted in it being
scrapped and sent to a home for Degenerate Cybermats, whither it
was followed by the girl who had inadvertently fallen deeply in
love with the unfortunate machine, with the result (a) that
Zaphod never got near her and (b) that he missed out on a period
of ancient history that would have been of inestimable value to
him at this moment.
He stared at them in shock.
It was impossible to explain why, but their smooth and sleek
white bodies seemed to be the utter embodiment of clean, clinical
evil. From their hideously dead eyes to their powerful lifeless
feet, they were clearly the calculated product of a mind that
wanted simply to kill. Zaphod gulped in cold fear.
They had been dismantling part of the rear bridge wall, and had
forced a passage through some of the vital innards of the ship.
Through the tangled wreckage Zaphod could see, with a further and
worse sense of shock, that they were tunnelling towards the very
heart of the ship, the heart of the Improbability Drive that had
been so mysteriously created out of thin air, the Heart of Gold
itself.
The robot closest to him was regarding him in such a way as to
suggest that it was measuring every smallest particle of his
body, mind and capability. And when it spoke, what it said seemed
to bear this impression out. Before going on to what it actually
said, it is worth recording at this point that Zaphod was the
first living organic being to hear one of these creatures speak
for something over ten billion years. If he had paid more
attention to his ancient history lessons and less to his organic
being, he might have been more impressed by this honour.
The robot's voice was like its body, cold, sleek and lifeless. It
had almost a cultured rasp to it. It sounded as ancient as it
was.
It said, "You do have a Kill-O-Zap blaster pistol in your hand."
Zaphod didn't know what it meant for a moment, but then he
glanced down at his own hand and was relieved to see that what he
had found clipped to a wall bracket was indeed what he had
thought it was.
"Yeah," he said in a kind of relieved sneer, which is quite
tricky, "well, I wouldn't want to overtax your imagination,
robot." For a while nobody said anything, and Zaphod realized
that the robots were obviously not here to make conversation, and
that it was up to him.
"I can't help noticing that you have parked your ship," he said
with a nod of one of his heads in the appropriate direction,
"through mine."
There was no denying this. Without regard for any kind of proper
dimensional behaviour they had simply materialized their ship
precisely where they wanted it to be, which meant that it was
simply locked through the Heart of Gold as if they were nothing
more than two combs.
Again, they made no response to this, and Zaphod wondered if the
conversation would gather any momentum if he phrased his part of
it in the form of questions.
"... haven't you?" he added.
"Yes," replied the robot."
"Er, OK," said Zaphod. "So what are you cats doing here?"
Silence.
"Robots," said Zaphod, "what are you robots doing here?"
"We have come," rasped the robot, "for the Gold of the Bail."
Zaphod nodded. He waggled his gun to invite further elaboration.
The robot seemed to understand this.
"The Gold Bail is part of the Key we seek," continued the robot,
"to release our Masters from Krikkit."
Zaphod nodded again. He waggled his gun again.
"The Key," continued the robot simply, "was disintegrated in time
and space. The Golden Bail is embedded in the device which drives
your ship. It will be reconstituted in the Key. Our Masters shall
be released. The Universal Readjustment will continue."
Zaphod nodded again.
"What are you talking about?" he said.
A slightly pained expression seemed to cross the robot's totally
expressionless face. He seemed to be finding the conversation
depressing.
"Obliteration," it said. "We seek the Key," it repeated, "we
already have the Wooden Pillar, the Steel Pillar and the Perspex
Pillar. In a moment we will have the Gold Bail ..."
"No you won't."
"We will," stated the robot.
"No you won't. It makes my ship work."
"In a moment," repeated the robot patiently, "we will have the
Gold Bail ..."
"You will not," said Zaphod.
"And then we must go," said the robot, in all seriousness, "to a
party."
"Oh," said Zaphod, startled. "Can I come?"
"No," said the robot. "We are going to shoot you."
"Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, waggling his gun.
"Yes," said the robot, and they shot him.
Zaphod was so surprised that they had to shoot him again before
he fell down.
"Shhh," said Slartibartfast. "Listen and watch."
Night had now fallen on ancient Krikkit. The sky was dark and
empty. The only light was coming from the nearby town, from which
pleasant convivial sounds were drifting quietly on the breeze.
They stood beneath a tree from which heady fragrances wafted
around them. Arthur squatted and felt the Informational Illusion
of the soil and the grass. He ran it through his fingers. The
soil seemed heavy and rich, the grass strong. It was hard to
avoid the impression that this was a thoroughly delightful place
in all respects.
The sky was, however, extremely blank and seemed to Arthur to
cast a certain chill over the otherwise idyllic, if currently
invisible, landscape. Still, he supposed, it's a question of what
you're used to.
He felt a tap on his shoulder and looked up. Slartibartfast was
quietly directing his attention to something down the other side
of the hill. He looked and could just see some faint lights
dancing and waving, and moving slowly in their direction.
As they came nearer, sounds became audible too, and soon the dim
lights and noises resolved themselves into a small group of
people who were walking home across the hill towards the town.
They walked quite near the watchers beneath the tree, swinging
lanterns which made soft and crazy lights dance among the trees
and grass, chattering contentedly, and actually singing a song
about how terribly nice everything was, how happy they were, how
much they enjoyed working on the farm, and how pleasant it was to
be going home to see their wives and children, with a lilting
chorus to the effect that the flowers were smelling particularly
nice at this time of year and that it was a pity the dog had died
seeing as it liked them so much. Arthur could almost imagine Paul
McCartney sitting with his feet up by the fire on evening,
humming it to Linda and wondering what to buy with the proceeds,
and thinking probably Essex.
"The Masters of Krikkit," breathed Slartibartfast in sepulchral
tones.
Coming, as it did, so hard upon the heels of his own thoughts
about Essex this remark caused Arthur a moment's confusion. Then
the logic of the situation imposed itself on his scattered mind,
and he discovered that he still didn't understand what the old
man meant.
"What?" he said.
"The Masters of Krikkit," said Slartibartfast again, and if his
breathing had been sepulchral before, this time he sounded like
someone in Hades with bronchitis.
Arthur peered at the group and tried to make sense of what little
information he had at his disposal at this point.
The people in the group were clearly alien, if only because they
seemed a little tall, thin, angular and almost as pale as to be
white, but otherwise they appeared remarkably pleasant; a little
whimsical perhaps, one wouldn't necessarily want to spend a long
coach journey with them, but the point was that if they deviated
in any way from being good straightforward people it was in being
perhaps too nice rather than not nice enough. So why all this
rasping lungwork from Slartibartfast which would seem more
appropriate to a radio commercial for one of those nasty films
about chainsaw operators taking their work home with them?
Then, this Krikkit angle was a tough one, too. He hadn't quite
fathomed the connection between what he knew as cricket, and what
...
Slartibartfast interrupted his train of thought at this point as
if sensing what was going through his mind.
"The game you know as cricket," he said, and his voice still
seemed to be wandering lost in subterranean passages, "is just
one of those curious freaks of racial memory which can keep
images alive in the mind aeons after their true significance has
been lost in the mists of time. Of all the races on the Galaxy,
only the English could possibly revive the memory of the most
horrific wars ever to sunder the Universe and transform it into
what I'm afraid is generally regarded as an incomprehensibly dull
and pointless game.
"Rather fond of it myself," he added, "but in most people's eyes
you have been inadvertently guilty of the most grotesque bad
taste. Particularly the bit about the little red ball hitting the
wicket, that's very nasty."
"Um," said Arthur with a reflective frown to indicate that his
cognitive synapses were coping with this as best as they could,
"um."
"And these," said Slartibartfast, slipping back into crypt
guttural and indicating the group of Krikkit men who had now
walked past them, "are the ones who started it all, and it will
start tonight. Come, we will follow, and see why."
They slipped out from underneath the tree, and followed the
cheery party along the dark hill path. Their natural instinct was
to tread quietly and stealthily in pursuit of their quarry,
though, as they were simply walking through a recorded
Informational Illusion, they could as easily have been wearing
euphoniums and woad for all the notice their quarry would have
taken of them.
Arthur noticed that a couple of members of the party were now
singing a different song. It came lilting back to them through
the soft night air, and was a sweet romantic ballad which would
have netted McCartney Kent and Sussex and enabled him to put in a
fair offer for Hampshire.
"You must surely know," said Slartibartfast to Ford, "what it is
that is about to happen?"
"Me?" said Ford. "No."
"Did you not learn Ancient Galactic History when you were a
child?"
"I was in the cybercubicle behind Zaphod," said Ford, "it was
very distracting. Which isn't to say that I didn't learn some
pretty stunning things."
At this point Arthur noticed a curious feature to the song that
the party were singing. The middle eight bridge, which would have
had McCartney firmly consolidated in Winchester and gazing
intently over the Test Valley to the rich pickings of the New
Forest beyond, had some curious lyrics. The songwriter was
referring to meeting with a girl not "under the moon" or "beneath
the stars" but "above the grass", which struck Arthur a little
prosaic. Then he looked up again at the bewildering black sky,
and had the distinct feeling that there was an important point
here, if only he could grasp what it was. It gave him a feeling
of being alone in the Universe, and he said so.
"No," said Slartibartfast, with a slight quickening of his step,
"the people of Krikkit have never thought to themselves We are
alone in the Universe.' They are surrounded by a huge Dust Cloud,
you see, their single sun with its single world, and they are
right out on the utmost eastern edge of the Galaxy. Because of
the Dust Cloud there has never been anything to see in the sky.
At night it is totally blank, During the day there is the sun,
but you can't look directly at that so they don't. They are
hardly aware of the sky. It's as if they had a blind spot which
extended degrees from horizon to horizon.
"You see, the reason why they have never thought We are alone in
the Universe' is that until tonight they don't know about the
Universe. Until tonight."
He moved on, leaving the words ringing in the air behind him.
"Imagine," he said, "never even thinking We are alone' simply
because it has never occurred to you to think that there's any
other way to be."
He moved on again.
"I'm afraid this is going to be a little unnerving," he added.
As he spoke, they became aware of a very thin roaring scream high
up in the sightless sky above them. They glanced upwards in
alarm, but for a moment or two could see nothing.
Then Arthur noticed that the people in the party in front of them
had heard the noise, but that none of them seemed to know what to
so with it. They were glancing around themselves in
consternation, left, right, forwards, backwards, even at the
ground. It never occurred to them to look upwards.
The profoundness of the shock and horror they emanated a few
moments later when the burning wreckage of a spaceship came
hurtling and screaming out of the sky and crashed about half a
mile from where they were standing was something that you had to
be there to experience.
Some speak of the Heart of Gold in hushed tones, some of the
Starship Bistromath.
Many speak of the legendary and gigantic Starship Titanic, a
majestic and luxurious cruise-liner launched from the great
shipbuilding asteroid complexes of Artifactovol some hundreds of
years ago now, and with good reason.
It was sensationally beautiful, staggeringly huge, and more
pleasantly equipped than any ship in what now remains of history
(see note below on the Campaign for Real Time) but it had the
misfortune to be built in the very earliest days of Improbability
Physics, long before this difficult and cussed branch of
knowledge was fully, or at all, understood.
The designers and engineers decided, in their innocence, to build
a prototype Improbability Field into it, which was meant,
supposedly, to ensure that it was Infinitely Improbable that
anything would ever go wrong with any part of the ship.
They did not realize that because of the quasi-reciprocal and
circular nature of all Improbability calculations, anything that
was Infinitely Improbable was actually very likely to happen
almost immediately.
The Starship Titanic was a monstrously pretty sight as it lay
beached like a silver Arcturan Megavoidwhale amongst the laser-
lit tracery of its construction gantries, a brilliant cloud of
pins and needles of light against the deep interstellar
blackness; but when launched, it did not even manage to complete
its very first radio message - an SOS - before undergoing a
sudden and gratuitous total existence failure.
However, the same event which saw the disastrous failure of one
science in its infancy also witnessed the apotheosis of another.
It was conclusively proven that more people watched the tri-d
coverage of the launch than actually existed at the time, and
this has now been recognized as the greatest achievement ever in
the science of audience research.
Another spectacular media event of that time was the supernova
which the star Ysllodins underwent a few hours later. Ysllodins
is the star around which most of the Galaxy's major insurance
underwriters live, or rather lived.
But whilst these spaceships, and other great ones which come to
mind, such as the Galactic Fleet Battleships - the GSS Daring,
the GSS Audacy and the GSS Suicidal Insanity - are all spoken of
with awe, pride, enthusiasm, affection, admiration, regret,
jealousy, resentment, in fact most of the better known emotions,
the one which regularly commands the most actual astonishment was
Krikkit One, the first spaceship ever built by the people of
Krikkit. This is not because it was a wonderful ship. It wasn't.
It was a crazy piece of near junk. It looked as if it had been
knocked up in somebody's backyard, and this was in fact precisely
where it had been knocked up. The astonishing thing about the
ship was not that it was one well (it wasn't) but that it was
done at all. The period of time which had elapsed between the
moment that the people of Krikkit had discovered that there was
such a thing as space and the launching of their first spaceship
was almost exactly a year.
Ford Prefect was extremely grateful, as he strapped himself in,
that this was just another Informational Illusion, and that he
was therefore completely safe. In real life it wasn't a ship he
would have set foot in for all the rice wine in China. "Extremely
rickety" was one phrase which sprang to mind, and "Please may I
get out?" was another.
"This is going to fly?" said Arthur, giving gaunt looks, at the
lashed-together pipework and wiring which festooned the cramped
interior of the ship.
Slartibartfast assured him that it would, that they were
perfectly safe and that it was all going to be extremely
instructive and not a little harrowing.
Ford and Arthur decided just to relax and be harrowed.
"Why not," said Ford, "go mad?"
In front of them and, of course, totally unaware of their
presence for the very good reason that they weren't actually
there, were the three pilots. They had also constructed the ship.
They had been on the hill path that night singing wholesome
heartwarming songs. Their brains had been very slightly turned by
the nearby crash of the alien spaceship. They had spent weeks
stripping every tiniest last secret out of the wreckage of that
burnt-up spaceship, all the while singing lilting spaceship-
stripping ditties. They had then built their own ship and this
was it. This was their ship, and they were currently singing a
little song about that too, expressing the twin joys of
achievement and ownership. The chorus was a little poignant, and
told of their sorrow that their work had kept them such long
hours in the garage, away from the company of their wives and
children, who had missed them terribly but had kept them cheerful
by bringing them continual stories of how nicely the puppy was
growing up.
Pow, they took off.
They roared into the sky like a ship that knew precisely what it
was doing.
"No way," said Ford a while later after they had recovered from
the shock of acceleration, and were climbing up out of the
planet's atmosphere, "no way," he repeated, "does anyone design
and build a ship like this in a year, no matter how motivated. I
don't believe it. Prove it to me and I still won't believe it."
He shook his head thoughtfully and gazed out of a tiny port at
the nothingness outside it.
The trip passed uneventfully for a while, and Slartibartfast
fastwound them through it.
Very quickly, therefore, they arrived at the inner perimeter of
the hollow, spherical Dust Cloud which surrounded their sun and
home planet, occupying, as it were, the next orbit out.
It was more as if there was a gradual change in the texture and
consistency of space. The darkness seemed now to thrum and ripple
past them. It was a very cold darkness, a very blank and heavy
darkness, it was the darkness of the night sky of Krikkit.
The coldness and heaviness and blankness of it took a slow grip
on Arthur's heart, and he felt acutely aware of the feelings of
the Krikkit pilots which hung in the air like a thick static
charge. They were now on the very boundary of the historical
knowledge of their race. This was the very limit beyond which
none of them had ever speculated, or even known that there was
any speculation to be done.
The darkness of the cloud buffeted at the ship. Inside was the
silence of history. Their historic mission was to find out if
there was anything or anywhere on the other side of the sky, from
which the wrecked spaceship could have come, another world maybe,
strange and incomprehensible though this thought was to the
enclosed minds of those who had lived beneath the sky of Krikkit.
History was gathering itself to deliver another blow.
Still the darkness thrummed at them, the blank enclosing
darkness. It seemed closer and closer, thicker and thicker,
heavier and heavier. And suddenly it was gone.
They flew out of the cloud.
They saw the staggering jewels of the night in their infinite
dust and their minds sang with fear.
For a while they flew on, motionless against the starry sweep of
the Galaxy, itself motionless against the infinite sweep of the
Universe. And then they turned round.
"It'll have to go," the men of Krikkit said as they headed back
for home.
On the way back they sang a number of tuneful and reflective
songs on the subjects of peace, justice, morality, culture,
sport, family life and the obliteration of all other life forms.
"So you see," said Slartibartfast, slowly stirring his
artificially constructed coffee, and thereby also stirring the
whirlpool interfaces between real and unreal numbers, between the
interactive perceptions of mind and Universe, and thus generating
the restructured matrices of implicitly enfolded subjectivity
which allowed his ship to reshape the very concept of time and
space, "how it is."
"Yes," said Arthur.
"Yes," said Ford.
"What do I do," said Arthur, "with this piece of chicken?"
Slartibartfast glanced at him gravely.
"Toy with it," he said, "toy with it."
He demonstrated with his own piece.
Arthur did so, and felt the slight tingle of a mathematical
function thrilling through the chicken leg as it moved four-
dimensionally through what Slartibartfast had assured him was
five-dimensional space.
"Overnight," said Slartibartfast, "the whole population of
Krikkit was transformed from being charming, delightful,
intelligent ..."
"... if whimsical ..." interpolated Arthur.
"... ordinary people," said Slartibartfast, "into charming,
delightful, intelligent ..."
"... whimsical ..."
"... manic xenophobes. The idea of a Universe didn't fit into
their world picture, so to speak. They simply couldn't cope with
it. And so, charmingly, delightfully, intelligently, whimsically
if you like, they decided to destroy it. What's the matter now?"
"I don't like the wine very much," said Arthur sniffing it.
"Well, send it back. It's all part of the mathematics of it."
Arthur did so. He didn't like the topography of the waiter's
smile, but he'd never liked graphs anyway.
"Where are we going?" said Ford.
"Back to the Room of Informational Illusions," said
Slartibartfast, rising and patting his mouth with the
mathematical representation of a paper napkin, "for the second
half."
"The people of Krikkit," said His High Judgmental Supremacy,
Judiciary Pag, LIVR (the Learned, Impartial and Very Relaxed)
Chairman of the Board of Judges at the Krikkit War Crimes Trial,
"are, well, you know, they're just a bunch of real sweet guys,
you know, who just happen to want to kill everybody. Hell, I feel
the same way some mornings. Shit.
"OK," he continued, swinging his feet up on to the bench in front
of him and pausing a moment to pick a thread off his Ceremonial
Beach Loafers, "so you wouldn't necessarily want to share a
Galaxy with these guys."
This was true.
The Krikkit attack on the Galaxy had been stunning. Thousands and
thousands of huge Krikkit warships had leapt suddenly out of
hyperspace and simultaneously attacked thousands and thousands of
major worlds, first seizing vital material supplies for building
the next wave, and then calmly zapping those worlds out of
existence.
The Galaxy, which had been enjoying a period of unusual peace and
prosperity at the time, reeled like a man getting mugged in a
meadow.
"I mean," continued Judiciary Pag, gazing round the ultra-modern
(this was ten billion years ago, when "ultra-modern" meant lots
of stainless steel and brushed concrete) and huge courtroom,
"these guys are just obsessed."
This too was true, and is the only explanation anyone has yet
managed to come up with for the unimaginable speed with which the
people of Krikkit had pursued their new and absolute purpose -
the destruction of everything that wasn't Krikkit.
It is also the only explanation for their bewildering sudden
grasp of all the hypertechnology involved in building their
thousands of spaceships, and their millions of lethal white
robots.
These had really struck terror into the hearts of everyone who
had encountered them - in most cases, however, the terror was
extremely short-lived, as was the person experiencing the terror.
They were savage, single-minded flying battle machines. They
wielded formidable multifunctional battleclubs which, brandished
one way, would knock down buildings and, brandished another way,
fired blistering Omni-Destructo Zap Rays and, brandished a third
way, launched a hideous arsenal of grenades, ranging from minor
incendiary devices to Maxi-Slorta Hypernuclear Devices which
could take out a major sun. Simply striking the grenades with the
battleclubs simultaneously primed them, and launched them with
phenomenal accuracy over distances ranging from mere yards to
hundreds of thousands of miles.
"OK," said Judiciary Pag again, "so we won." He paused and chewed
a little gum. "We won," he repeated, "but that's no big deal. I
mean a medium-sized galaxy against one little world, and how long
did it take us? Clerk of the Court?"
"M'lud?" said the severe little man in black, rising.
"How long, kiddo?"
"It is a trifle difficult, m'lud, to be precise in this matter.
Time and distance ..."
"Relax, guy, be vague."
"I hardly like to be vague, m'lud, over such a ..."
"Bite the bullet and be it."
The Clerk of the Court blinked at him. It was clear that like
most of the Galactic legal profession he found Judiciary Pag (or
Zipo Bibrok, as his private name was known, inexplicably,
to be) a rather distressing figure. He was clearly a bounder and
a cad. He seemed to think that the fact that he was the possessor
of the finest legal mind ever discovered gave him the right to
behave exactly as he liked, and unfortunately he appeared to be
right.
"Er, well, m'lud, very approximately, two thousand years," the
Clerk murmured unhappily.
"And how many guys zilched out?"
"Two grillion, m'lud." The Clerk sat down. A hydrospectic photo
of him at this point would have revealed that he was steaming
slightly.
Judiciary Pag gazed once more around the courtroom, wherein were
assembled hundreds of the very highest officials of the entire
Galactic administration, all in their ceremonial uniforms or
bodies, depending on metabolism and custom. Behind a wall of
Zap-Proof Crystal stood a representative group of the people of
Krikkit, looking with calm, polite loathing at all the aliens
gathered to pass judgment on them. This was the most momentous
occasion in legal history, and Judiciary Pag knew it.
He took out his chewing gum and stuck it under his chair.
"That's a whole lotta stiffs," he said quietly.
The grim silence in the courtroom seemed in accord with this
view.
"So, like I said, these are a bunch of really sweet guys, but you
wouldn't want to share a Galaxy with them, not if they're just
gonna keep at it, not if they're not gonna learn to relax a
little. I mean it's just gonna be continual nervous time, isn't
it, right? Pow, pow, pow, when are they next coming at us?
Peaceful coexistence is just right out, right? Get me some water
somebody, thank you."
He sat back and sipped reflectively.
"OK," he said, "hear me, hear me. It's, like, these guys, you
know, are entitled to their own view of the Universe. And
according to their view, which the Universe forced on them,
right, they did right. Sounds crazy, but I think you'll agree.
They believe in ..."
He consulted a piece of paper which he found in the back pocket
of his Judicial jeans.
"They believe in peace, justice, morality, culture, sport,
family life, and the obliteration of all other life forms'."
He shrugged.
"I've heard a lot worse," he said.
He scratched his crotch reflectively.
"Freeeow," he said. He took another sip of water, then held it up
to the light and frowned at it. He twisted it round.
"Hey, is there something in this water?" he said.
"Er, no, m'lud," said the Court Usher who had brought it to him,
rather nervously.
"Then take it away," snapped Judiciary Pag, "and put something in
it. I got an idea."
He pushed away the glass and leaned forward.
"Hear me, hear me," he said.
The solution was brilliant, and went like this:
The planet of Krikkit was to be enclosed for perpetuity in an
envelope of Slo-Time, inside which life would continue almost
infinitely slowly. All light would be deflected round the
envelope so that it would remain invisible and impenetrable.
Escape from the envelope would be utterly impossible unless it
were locked from the outside.
When the rest of the Universe came to its final end, when the
whole of creation reached its dying fall (this was all, of
course, in the days before it was known that the end of the
Universe would be a spectacular catering venture) and life and
matter ceased to exist, then the planet of Krikkit and its sun
would emerge from its Slo-Time envelope and continue a solitary
existence, such as it craved, in the twilight of the Universal
void.
The Lock would be on an asteroid which would slowly orbit the
envelope.
The key would be the symbol of the Galaxy - the Wikkit Gate.
By the time the applause in the court had died down, Judiciary
Pag was already in the Sens-O-Shower with a rather nice member of
the jury that he'd slipped a note to half an hour earlier.
Two months later, Zipo Bibrok had cut the bottoms off his
Galactic State jeans, and was spending part of the enormous fee
his judgments commanded lying on a jewelled beach having Essence
of Qualactin rubbed into his back by the same rather nice member
of the jury. She was a Soolfinian girl from beyond the
Cloudworlds of Yaga. She had skin like lemon silk and was very
interested in legal bodies.
"Did you hear the news?" she said.
"Weeeeelaaaaah!" said Zipo Bibrok, and you would have had
to have been there to know exactly why he said this. None of this
was on the tape of Informational Illusions, and is all based on
hearsay.
"No," he added, when the thing that had made him say
"Weeeeelaaaaah" had stopped happening. He moved his body round
slightly to catch the first rays of the third and greatest of
primeval Vod's three suns which was now creeping over the
ludicrously beautiful horizon, and the sky now glittered with
some of the greatest tanning power ever known.
A fragrant breeze wandered up from the quiet sea, trailed along
the beach, and drifted back to sea again, wondering where to go
next. On a mad impulse it went up to the beach again. It drifted
back to sea.
"I hope it isn't good news," muttered Zipo Bibrok, "because
I don't think I could bear it."
"Your Krikkit judgment was carried out today," said the girl
sumptuously. There was no need to say such a straightforward
thing sumptuously, but she went ahead and did it anyway because
it was that sort of day. "I heard it on the radio," she said,
"when I went back to the ship for the oil."
"Uhuh," muttered Zipo and rested his head back on the jewelled
sand.
"Something happened," she said.
"Mmmm?"
"Just after the Slo-Time envelope was locked," she said, and
paused a moment from rubbing in the Essence of Qualactin, "a
Krikkit warship which had been missing presumed destroyed turned
out to be just missing after all. It appeared and tried to seize
the Key."
Zipo sat up sharply.
"Hey, what?" he said.
"it's all right," she said in a voice which would have calmed the
Big Bang down. "Apparently there was a short battle. The Key and
the warship were disintegrated and blasted into the space-time
continuum. Apparently they are lost for ever."
She smiled, and ran a little more Essence of Qualactin on to her
fingertips. He relaxed and lay back down.
"Do what you did a moment or two ago," he murmured.
"That?" she said.
"No, no," he said, "that."
She tried again.
"That?" she asked.
"Weeeeelaaaaah!"
Again, you had to be there.
The fragrant breeze drifted up from the sea again.
A magician wandered along the beach, but no one needed him.
"Nothing is lost for ever," said Slartibartfast, his face
flickering redly in the light of the candle which the robot
waiter was trying to take away, "except for the Cathedral of
Chalesm."
"The what?" said Arthur with a start.
"The Cathedral of Chalesm," repeated Slartibartfast. "It was
during the course of my researches at the Campaign for Real Time
that I ..."
"The what?" said Arthur again.
The old man paused and gathered his thoughts, for what he hoped
would be one last onslaught on his story. The robot waiter moved
through the space-time matrices in a way which spectacularly
combined the surly with the obsequious, made a snatch for the
candle and got it. They had had the bill, had argued convincingly
about who had had the cannelloni and how many bottles of wine
they had had, and, as Arthur had been dimly aware, had thereby
successfully manoeuvred the ship out of subjective space and into
a parking orbit round a strange planet. The waiter was now
anxious to complete his part of the charade and clear the bistro.
"All will become clear," said Slartibartfast.
"When?"
"In a minute. Listen. The time streams are now very polluted.
There's a lot of muck floating about in them, flotsam and jetsam,
and more and more of it is now being regurgitated into the
physical world. Eddies in the space-time continuum, you see."
"So I hear," said Arthur.
"Look, where are we going?" said Ford, pushing his chair back
from the table with impatience. "Because I'm eager to get there."
"We are going," said Slartibartfast in a slow, measured voice,
"to try to prevent the war robots of Krikkit from regaining the
whole of the Key they need to unlock the planet of Krikkit from
the Slo-Time envelope and release the rest of their army and
their mad Masters."
"It's just," said Ford, "that you mentioned a party."
"I did," said Slartibartfast, and hung his head.
He realized that it had been a mistake, because the idea seemed
to exercise a strange and unhealthy fascination on the mind of
Ford Prefect. The more that Slartibartfast unravelled the dark
and tragic story of Krikkit and its people, the more Ford Prefect
wanted to drink a lot and dance with girls.
The old man felt that he should not have mentioned the party
until he absolutely had to. But there it was, the fact was out,
and Ford Prefect had attached himself to it the way an Arcturan
Megaleach attaches itself to its victim before biting his head
off and making off with his spaceship.
"When," said Ford eagerly, "do we get there?"
"When I've finished telling you why we have to go there."
"I know why I'm going," said Ford, and leaned back, sticking his
hands behind his head. He gave one of his smiles which made
people twitch.
Slartibartfast had hoped for an easy retirement.
He had been planning to learn to play the octraventral
heebiephone - a pleasantly futile task, he knew, because he had
the wrong number of mouths.
He had also been planning to write an eccentric and relentlessly
inaccurate monograph on the subject of equatorial fjords in order
to set the record wrong about one or two matters he saw as
important.
Instead, he had somehow got talked into doing some part-time work
for the Campaign for Real Time and had started to take it all
seriously for the first time in his life. As a result he now
found himself spending his fast-declining years combating evil
and trying to save the Galaxy.
He found it exhausting work and sighed heavily.
"Listen," he said, "at Camtim ..."
"What?" said Arthur.
"The Campaign for Real Time, which I will tell you about later. I
noticed that five pieces of jetsam which had in relatively recent
times plopped back into existence seemed to correspond to the
five pieces of the missing Key. Only two I could trace exactly -
the Wooden Pillar, which appeared on your planet, and the Silver
Bail. It seems to be at some sort of party. We must go there to
retrieve it before the Krikkit robots find it, or who knows what
may hap?"
"No," said Ford firmly. "We must go to the party in order to
drink a lot and dance with girls."
"But haven't you understood everything I ...?"
"Yes," said Ford, with a sudden and unexpected fierceness, "I've
understood it all perfectly well. That's why I want to have as
many drinks and dance with as many girls as possible while there
are still any left. If everything you've shown us is true ..."
"True? Of course it's true."
"... then we don't stand a whelk's chance in a supernova."
"A what?" said Arthur sharply again. He had been following the
conversation doggedly up to this point, and was keen not to lose
the thread now.
"A whelk's chance in a supernova," repeated Ford without losing
momentum. "The ..."
"What's a whelk got to do with a supernova?" said Arthur.
"It doesn't," said Ford levelly, "stand a chance in one."
He paused to see if the matter was now cleared up. The freshly
puzzled looks clambering across Arthur's face told him that it
wasn't.
"A supernova," said Ford as quickly and as clearly as he could,
"is a star which explodes at almost half the speed of light and
burns with the brightness of a billion suns and then collapses as
a super-heavy neutron star. It's a star which burns up other
stars, got it? Nothing stands a chance in a supernova."
"I see," said Arthur.
"The ..."
"So why a whelk particularly?"
"Why not a whelk? Doesn't matter."
Arthur accepted this, and Ford continued, picking up his early
fierce momentum as best he could.
"The point is," he said, "that people like you and me,
Slartibartfast, and Arthur - particularly and especially Arthur -
are just dilletantes, eccentrics, layabouts, fartarounds if you
like."
Slartibartfast frowned, partly in puzzlement and partly in
umbrage. He started to speak.
"- ..." is as far as he got.
"We're not obsessed by anything, you see," insisted Ford.
"..."
"And that's the deciding factor. We can't win against obsession.
They care, we don't. They win."
"I care about lots of things," said Slartibartfast, his voice
trembling partly with annoyance, but partly also with
uncertainty.
"Such as?"
"Well," said the old man, "life, the Universe. Everything,
really. Fjords."
"Would you die for them?"
"Fjords?" blinked Slartibartfast in surprise. "No."
"Well then."
"Wouldn't see the point, to be honest."
"And I still can't see the connection," said Arthur, "with
whelks."
Ford could feel the conversation slipping out of his control, and
refused to be sidetracked by anything at this point.
"The point is," he hissed, "that we are not obsessive people, and
we don't stand a chance against ..."
"Except for your sudden obsession with whelks," pursued Arthur,
"which I still haven't understood."
"Will you please leave whelks out of it?"
"I will if you will," said Arthur. "You brought the subject up."
"It was an error," said Ford, "forget them. The point is this."
He leant forward and rested his forehead on the tips of his
fingers.
"What was I talking about?" he said wearily.
"Let's just go down to the party," said Slartibartfast, "for
whatever reason." He stood up, shaking his head.
"I think that's what I was trying to say," said Ford.
For some unexplained reason, the teleport cubicles were in the
bathroom.
Time travel is increasingly regarded as a menace. History is
being polluted.
The Encyclopedia Galactica has much to say on the theory and
practice of time travel, most of which is incomprehensible to
anyone who hasn't spent at least four lifetimes studying advanced
hypermathematics, and since it was impossible to do this before
time travel was invented, there is a certain amount of confusion
as to how the idea was arrived at in the first place. One
rationalization of this problem states that time travel was, by
its very nature, discovered simultaneously at all periods of
history, but this is clearly bunk.
The trouble is that a lot of history is now quite clearly bunk as
well.
Here is an example. It may not seem to be an important one to
some people, but to others it is crucial. It is certainly
significant in that it was the single event which caused the
Campaign for Real Time to be set up in the first place (or is it
last? It depends which way round you see history as happening,
and this too is now an increasingly vexed question).
There is, or was, a poet. His name was Lallafa, and he wrote what
are widely regarded throughout the Galaxy as being the finest
poems in existence, the Songs of the Long Land.
They are unspeakably wonderful. That is to say, you couldn't
speak very much of them at once without being so overcome with
emotion, truth and a sense of wholeness and oneness of things
that you wouldn't pretty soon need a brisk walk round the block,
possibly pausing at a bar on the way back for a quick glass of
perspective and soda. They were that good.
Lallafa had lived in the forests of the Long Lands of Effa. He
lived there, and he wrote his poems there. He wrote them on pages
made of dried habra leaves, without the benefit of education or
correcting fluid. He wrote about the light in the forest and what
he thought about that. He wrote about the darkness in the forest,
and what he thought about that. He wrote about the girl who had
left him and precisely what he thought about that.
Long after his death his poems were found and wondered over. News
of them spread like morning sunlight. For centuries they
illuminated and watered the lives of many people whose lives
might otherwise have been darker and drier.
Then, shortly after the invention of time travel, some major
correcting fluid manufacturers wondered whether his poems might
have been better still if he had had access to some high-quality
correcting fluid, and whether he might be persuaded to say a few
words on that effect.
They travelled the time waves, they found him, they explained the
situation - with some difficulty - to him, and did indeed
persuade him. In fact they persuaded him to such an effect that
he became extremely rich at their hands, and the girl about whom
he was otherwise destined to write which such precision never got
around to leaving him, and in fact they moved out of the forest
to a rather nice pad in town and he frequently commuted to the
future to do chat shows, on which he sparkled wittily.
He never got around to writing the poems, of course, which was a
problem, but an easily solved one. The manufacturers of
correcting fluid simply packed him off for a week somewhere with
a copy of a later edition of his book and a stack of dried habra
leaves to copy them out on to, making the odd deliberate mistake
and correction on the way.
Many people now say that the poems are suddenly worthless. Others
argue that they are exactly the same as they always were, so
what's changed? The first people say that that isn't the point.
They aren't quite sure what the point is, but they are quite sure
that that isn't it. They set up the Campaign for Real Time to try
to stop this sort of thing going on. Their case was considerably
strengthened by the fact that a week after they had set
themselves up, news broke that not only had the great Cathedral
of Chalesm been pulled down in order to build a new ion refinery,
but that the construction of the refinery had taken so long, and
had had to extend so far back into the past in order to allow ion
production to start on time, that the Cathedral of Chalesm had
now never been built in the first place. Picture postcards of the
cathedral suddenly became immensely valuable.
So a lot of history is now gone for ever. The Campaign for Real
Timers claim that just as easy travel eroded the differences
between one country and another, and between one world and
another, so time travel is now eroding the differences between
one age and another. "The past," they say, "is now truly like a
foreign country. They do things exactly the same there."
Arthur materialized, and did so with all the customary staggering
about and clasping at his throat, heart and various limbs which
he still indulged himself in whenever he made any of these
hateful and painful materializations that he was determined not
to let himself get used to.
He looked around for the others.
They weren't there.
He looked around for the others again.
They still weren't there.
He closed his eyes.
He opened them
He looked around for the others.
They obstinately persisted in their absence.
He closed his eyes again, preparatory to making this completely
futile exercise once more, and because it was only then, whilst
his eyes were closed, that his brain began to register what his
eyes had been looking at whilst they were open, a puzzled frown
crept across his face.
So he opened his eyes again to check his facts and the frown
stayed put.
If anything, it intensified, and got a good firm grip. If this
was a party it was a very bad one, so bad, in fact, that
everybody else had left. He abandoned this line of thought as
futile. Obviously this wasn't a party. It was a cave, or a
labyrinth, or a tunnel of something - there was insufficient
light to tell. All was darkness, a damp shiny darkness. The only
sounds were the echoes of his own breathing, which sounded
worried. He coughed very slightly, and then had to listen to the
thin ghostly echo of his cough trailing away amongst winding
corridors and sightless chambers, as of some great labyrinth, and
eventually returning to him via the same unseen corridors, as if
to say ... "Yes?"
This happened to every slightest noise he made, and it unnerved
him. He tried to hum a cheery tune, but by the time it returned
to him it was a hollow dirge and he stopped.
His mind was suddenly full of images from the story that
Slartibartfast had been telling him. He half-expected suddenly to
see lethal white robots step silently from the shadows and kill
him. He caught his breath. They didn't. He let it go again. He
didn't know what he did expect.
Someone or something, however, seemed to be expecting him, for at
that moment there lit up suddenly in the dark distance an eerie
green neon sign.
It said, silently:
You have been Diverted
The sign flicked off again, in a way which Arthur was not at all
certain he liked. It flicked off with a sort of contemptuous
flourish. Arthur then tried to assure himself that this was just
a ridiculous trick of his imagination. A neon sign is either on
or off, depending on whether it has electricity running through
it or not. There was no way, he told himself, that it could
possibly effect the transition from one state to the other with a
contemptuous flourish. He hugged himself tightly in his dressing
gown and shivered, nevertheless.
The neon sign in the depths now suddenly lit up, bafflingly, with
just three dots and a comma. Like this:
Only in green neon.
It was trying, Arthur realized after staring at this perplexedly
for a second or two, to indicate that there was more to come,
that the sentence was not complete. Trying with almost superhuman
pedantry, he reflected. Or at least, inhuman pedantry.
The sentence then completed itself with these two words:
Arthur Dent.
He reeled. He steadied himself to have another clear look at it.
It still said Arthur Dent, so he reeled again.
Once again, the sign flicked off, and left him blinking in the
darkness with just the dim red image of his name jumping on his
retina.
Welcome, the sign now suddenly said.
After a moment, it added:
I Don't Think.
The stone-cold fear which had been hovering about Arthur all this
time, waiting for its moment, recognized that its moment had now
come and pounced on him. He tried to fight it off. He dropped
into a kind of alert crouch that he had once seen somebody do on
television, but it must have been someone with stronger knees. He
peered huntedly into the darkness.
"Er, hello?" he said.
He cleared his throat and said it again, more loudly and without
the "er". At some distance down the corridor it seemed suddenly
as if somebody started to beat on a bass drum.
He listened to it for a few seconds and realized that it was just
his heart beating.
He listened for a few seconds more and realized that it wasn't
his heart beating, it was somebody down the corridor beating on a
bass drum.
Beads of sweat formed on his brow, tensed themselves, and leapt
off. He put a hand out on the floor to steady his alert crouch,
which wasn't holding up very well. The sign changed itself again.
It said:
Do Not be Alarmed.
After a pause, it added:
Be Very Very Frightened, Arthur Dent.
Once again it flicked off. Once again it left him in darkness.
His eyes seemed to be popping out of his head. He wasn't certain
if this was because they were trying to see more clearly, or if
they simply wanted to leave at this point.
"Hello?" he said again, this time trying to put a note of rugged
and aggressive self-assertion into it. "Is anyone there?"
There was no reply, nothing.
This unnerved Arthur Dent even more than a reply would have done,
and he began to back away from the scary nothingness. And the
more he backed away, the more scared he became. After a while he
realized that the reason for this was because of all the films he
had seen in which the hero backs further and further away from
some imagined terror in front of him, only to bump into it coming
up from behind.
Just then it suddenly occurred to him to turn round rather
quickly.
There was nothing there.
Just blackness.
This really unnerved him, and he started to back away from that,
back the way he had come.
After doing this for a short while it suddenly occurred to him
that he was now backing towards whatever it was he had been
backing away from in the first place.
This, he couldn't help thinking, must be a foolish thing to do.
He decided he would be better off backing the way he had first
been backing, and turned around again.
It turned out at this point that his second impulse had been the
correct one, because there was an indescribably hideous monster
standing quietly behind him. Arthur yawed wildly as his skin
tried to jump one way and his skeleton the other, whilst his
brain tried to work out which of his ears it most wanted to crawl
out of.
"Bet you weren't expecting to see me again," said the monster,
which Arthur couldn't help thinking was a strange remark for it
to make, seeing as he had never met the creature before. He could
tell that he hadn't met the creature before from the simple fact
that he was able to sleep at nights. It was ... it was ... it was
...
Arthur blinked at it. It stood very still. It did look a little
familiar.
A terrible cold calm came over him as he realized that what he
was looking at was a six-foot-high hologram of a housefly.
He wondered why anybody would be showing him a six-foot-high
hologram of a housefly at this time. He wondered whose voice he
had heard.
It was a terribly realistic hologram.
It vanished.
"Or perhaps you remember me better," said the voice suddenly, and
it was a deep, hollow malevolent voice which sounded like molten
tar glurping out of a drum with evil on its mind, "as the
rabbit."
With a sudden ping, there was a rabbit there in the black
labyrinth with him, a huge, monstrously, hideously soft and
lovable rabbit - an image again, but one on which every single
soft and lovable hair seemed like a real and single thing growing
in its soft and lovable coat. Arthur was startled to see his own
reflection in its soft and lovable unblinking and extremely huge
brown eyes.
"Born in darkness," rumbled the voice, "raised in darkness. One
morning I poked my head for the first time into the bright new
world and got it split open by what felt suspiciously like some
primitive instrument made of flint.
"Made by you, Arthur Dent, and wielded by you. Rather hard as I
recall.
"You turned my skin into a bag for keeping interesting stones in.
I happen to know that because in my next life I came back as a
fly again and you swatted me. Again. Only this time you swatted
me with the bag you'd made of my previous skin.
"Arthur Dent, you are not merely a cruel and heartless man, you
are also staggeringly tactless."
The voice paused whilst Arthur gawped.
"I see you have lost the bag," said the voice. "Probably got
bored with it, did you?"
Arthur shook his head helplessly. He wanted to explain that he
had been in fact very fond of the bag and had looked after it
very well and had taken it with him wherever he went, but that
somehow every time he travelled anywhere he seemed inexplicably
to end up with the wrong bag and that, curiously enough, even as
they stood there he was just noticing for the first time that the
bag he had with him at the moment appeared to be made out of
rather nasty fake leopard skin, and wasn't the one he'd had a few
moments ago before he arrived in this whatever place it was, and
wasn't one he would have chosen himself and heaven knew what
would be in it as it wasn't his, and he would much rather have
his original bag back, except that he was of course terribly
sorry for having so peremptorily removed it, or rather its
component parts, i.e. the rabbit skin, from its previous owner,
viz. the rabbit whom he currently had the honour of attempting
vainly to address.
All he actually managed to say was "Erp".
"Meet the newt you trod on," said the voice.
And there was, standing in the corridor with Arthur, a giant
green scaly newt. Arthur turned, yelped, leapt backwards, and
found himself standing in the middle of the rabbit. He yelped
again, but could find nowhere to leap to.
"That was me, too," continued the voice in a low menacing rumble,
"as if you didn't know ..."
"Know?" said Arthur with a start. "Know?"
"The interesting thing about reincarnation," rasped the voice,
"is that most people, most spirits, are not aware that it is
happening to them."
He paused for effect. As far as Arthur was concerned there was
already quite enough effect going on.
"I was aware," hissed the voice, "that is, I became aware.
Slowly. Gradually."
He, whoever he was, paused again and gathered breath.
"I could hardly help it, could I?" he bellowed, "when the same
thing kept happening, over and over and over again! Every life I
ever lived, I got killed by Arthur Dent. Any world, any body, any
time, I'm just getting settled down, along comes Arthur Dent -
pow, he kills me.
"Hard not to notice. Bit of a memory jogger. Bit of a pointer.
Bit of a bloody giveaway!
"That's funny,' my spirit would say to itself as it winged its
way back to the netherworld after another fruitless Dent-ended
venture into the land of the living, that man who just ran over
me as I was hopping across the road to my favourite pond looked a
little familiar ...' And gradually I got to piece it together,
Dent, you multiple-me-murderer!"
The echoes of his voice roared up and down the corridors. Arthur
stood silent and cold, his head shaking with disbelief.
"Here's the moment, Dent," shrieked the voice, now reaching a
feverish pitch of hatred, "here's the moment when at last I
knew!"
It was indescribably hideous, the thing that suddenly opened up
in front of Arthur, making him gasp and gargle with horror, but
here's an attempt at a description of how hideous it was. It was
a huge palpitating wet cave with a vast, slimy, rough, whale-like
creature rolling around it and sliding over monstrous white
tombstones. High above the cave rose a vast promontory in which
could be seen the dark recesses of two further fearful caves,
which ...
Arthur Dent suddenly realized that he was looking at his own
mouth, when his attention was meant to be directed at the live
oyster that was being tipped helplessly into it.
He staggered back with a cry and averted his eyes.
When he looked again the appalling apparition had gone. The
corridor was dark and, briefly, silent. He was alone with his
thoughts. They were extremely unpleasant thoughts and would
rather have had a chaperone.
The next noise, when it came, was the low heavy roll of a large
section of wall trundling aside, revealing, for the moment, just
dark blackness behind it. Arthur looked into it in much the same
way that a mouse looks into a dark dog-kennel.
And the voice spoke to him again.
"Tell me it was a coincidence, Dent," it said. "I dare you to
tell me it was a coincidence!"
"It was a coincidence," said Arthur quickly.
"It was not!" came the answering bellow.
"It was," said Arthur, "it was ..."
"If it was a coincidence, then my name," roared the voice, "is
not Agrajag!!!"
"And presumably," said Arthur, "you would claim that that was
your name."
"Yes!" hissed Agrajag, as if he had just completed a rather deft
syllogism.
"Well, I'm afraid it was still a coincidence," said Arthur.
"Come in here and say that!" howled the voice, in sudden apoplexy
again.
Arthur walked in and said that it was a coincidence, or at least,
he nearly said that it was a coincidence. His tongue rather lost
its footing towards the end of the last word because the lights
came up and revealed what it was he had walked into.
It was a Cathedral of Hate.
It was the product of a mind that was not merely twisted, but
actually sprained.
It was huge. It was horrific.
It had a Statue in it.
We will come to the Statue in a moment.
The vast, incomprehensibly vast chamber looked as if it had been
carved out of the inside of a mountain, and the reason for this
was that that was precisely what it had been carved out of. It
seemed to Arthur to spin sickeningly round his head as he stood
and gaped at it.
It was black.
Where it wasn't black you were inclined to wish that it was,
because the colours with which some of the unspeakable details
were picked out ranged horribly across the whole spectrum of
eye-defying colours from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead, taking in
Liver Purple, Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow, Burnt hombre and
Gan Green on the way.
The unspeakable details which these colours picked out were
gargoyles which would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch.
The gargoyles all looked inwards from the walls, from the
pillars, from the flying buttresses, from the choir stalls,
towards the Statue, to which we will come in a moment.
And if the gargoyles would have put Francis Bacon off his lunch,
then it was clear from the gargoyles' faces that the Statue would
have put them off theirs, had they been alive to eat it, which
they weren't, and had anybody tried to serve them some, which
they wouldn't.
Around the monumental walls were vast engraved stone tablets in
memory of those who had fallen to Arthur Dent.
The names of some of those commemorated were underlined and had
asterisks against them. So, for instance, the name of a cow which
had been slaughtered and of which Arthur Dent had happened to eat
a fillet steak would have the plainest engraving, whereas the
name of a fish which Arthur had himself caught and then decided
he didn't like and left on the side of the plate had a double
underlining, three sets of asterisks and a bleeding dagger added
as decoration, just to make the point.
And what was most disturbing about all this, apart from the
Statue, to which we are, by degrees, coming, was the very clear
implication that all these people and creatures were indeed the
same person, over and over again.
And it was equally clear that this person was, however unfairly,
extremely upset and annoyed.
In fact it would be fair to say that he had reached a level of
annoyance the like of which had never been seen in the Universe.
It was an annoyance of epic proportions, a burning searing flame
of annoyance, an annoyance which now spanned the whole of time
and space in its infinite umbrage.
And this annoyance had been given its fullest expression in the
Statue in the centre of all this monstrosity, which was a statue
of Arthur Dent, and an unflattering one. Fifty feet tall if it
was an inch, there was not an inch of it which wasn't crammed
with insult to its subject matter, and fifty feet of that sort of
thing would be enough to make any subject feel bad. From the
small pimple on the side of his nose to the poorish cut of his
dressing gown, there was no aspect of Arthur Dent which wasn't
lambasted and vilified by the sculptor.
Arthur appeared as a gorgon, an evil, rapacious, ravenning,
bloodied ogre, slaughtering his way through an innocent one-man
Universe.
With each of the thirty arms which the sculptor in a fit of
artistic fervour had decided to give him, he was either braining
a rabbit, swatting a fly, pulling a wishbone, picking a flea out
of his hair, or doing something which Arthur at first looking
couldn't quite identify.
His many feet were mostly stamping on ants.
Arthur put his hands over his eyes, hung his head and shook it
slowly from side to side in sadness and horror at the craziness
of things.
And when he opened his eyes again, there in front of him stood
the figure of the man or creature, or whatever it was, that he
had supposedly been persecuting all this time.
"HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!" said Agrajag.
He, or it, or whatever, looked like a mad fat bat. He waddled
slowly around Arthur, and poked at him with bent claws.
"Look ...!" protested Arthur.
"HhhhhhrrrrrraaaaaaHHHHHH!!!" explained Agrajag, and Arthur
reluctantly accepted this on the grounds that he was rather
frightened by this hideous and strangely wrecked apparition.
Agrajag was black, bloated, wrinkled and leathery.
His batwings were somehow more frightening for being the pathetic
broken floundering things they were that if they had been strong,
muscular beaters of the air. The frightening thing was probably
the tenacity of his continued existence against all the physical
odds.
He had the most astounding collection of teeth.
They looked as if they each came from a completely different
animal, and they were ranged around his mouth at such bizarre
angles it seemed that if he ever actually tried to chew anything
he'd lacerate half his own face along with it, and possibly put
an eye out as well.
Each of his three eyes was small and intense and looked about as
sane as a fish in a privet bush.
"I was at a cricket match," he rasped.
This seemed on the face of it such a preposterous notion that
Arthur practically choked.
"Not in this body," screeched the creature, "not in this body!
This is my last body. My last life. This is my revenge body. My
kill-Arthur-Dent body. My last chance. I had to fight to get it,
too."
"But ..."
"I was at," roared Agrajag, "a cricket match! I had a weak heart
condition, but what, I said to my wife, can happen to me at a
cricket match? As I'm watching, what happens?
"Two people quite maliciously appear out of thin air just in
front of me. The last thing I can't help but notice before my
poor heart gives out in shock is that one of them is Arthur Dent
wearing a rabbit bone in his beard. Coincidence?"
"Yes," said Arthur.
"Coincidence?" screamed the creature, painfully thrashing its
broken wings, and opening a short gash on its right cheek with a
particularly nasty tooth. On closer examination, such as he'd
been hoping to avoid, Arthur noticed that much of Agrajag's face
was covered with ragged strips of black sticky plasters.
He backed away nervously. He tugged at his beard. He was appalled
to discover that in fact he still had the rabbit bone in it. He
pulled it out and threw it away.
"Look," he said, "it's just fate playing silly buggers with you.
With me. With us. It's a complete coincidence."
"What have you got against me, Dent?" snarled the creature,
advancing on him in a painful waddle.
"Nothing," insisted Arthur, "honestly, nothing."
Agrajag fixed him with a beady stare.
"Seems a strange way to relate to somebody you've got nothing
against, killing them all the time. Very curious piece of social
interaction, I would call that. I'd also call it a lie!"
"But look," said Arthur, "I'm very sorry. There's been a terrible
misunderstanding. I've got to go. Have you got a clock? I'm meant
to be helping save the Universe." He backed away still further.
Agrajag advanced still further.
"At one point," he hissed, "at one point, I decided to give up.
Yes, I would not come back. I would stay in the netherworld. And
what happened?"
Arthur indicated with random shakes of his head that he had no
idea and didn't want to have one either. He found he had backed
up against the cold dark stone that had been carved by who knew
what Herculean effort into a monstrous travesty of his bedroom
slippers. He glanced up at his own horrendously parodied image
towering above him. He was still puzzled as to what one of his
hands was meant to be doing.
"I got yanked involuntarily back into the physical world,"
pursued Agrajag, "as a bunch of petunias. In, I might add, a
bowl. This particularly happy little lifetime started off with
me, in my bowl, unsupported, three hundred miles above the
surface of a particularly grim planet. Not a naturally tenable
position for a bowl of petunias, you might think. And you'd be
right. That life ended a very short while later, three hundred
miles lower. In, I might add, the fresh wreckage of a whale. My
spirit brother."
He leered at Arthur with renewed hatred.
"On the way down," he snarled, "I couldn't help noticing a
flashy-looking white spaceship. And looking out of a port on this
flashy-looking spaceship was a smug-looking Arthur Dent.
Coincidence?!!"
"Yes!" yelped Arthur. He glanced up again, and realized that the
arm that had puzzled him was represented as wantonly calling into
existence a bowl of doomed petunias. This was not a concept which
leapt easily to the eye.
"I must go," insisted Arthur.
"You may go," said Agrajag, "after I have killed you."
"No, that won't be any use," explained Arthur, beginning to climb
up the hard stone incline of his carved slipper, "because I have
to save the Universe, you see. I have to find a Silver Bail,
that's the point. Tricky thing to do dead."
"Save the Universe!" spat Agrajag with contempt. "You should have
thought of that before you started your vendetta against me! What
about the time you were on Stavromula Beta and someone ..."
"I've never been there," said Arthur.
"... tried to assassinate you and you ducked. Who do you think
the bullet hit? What did you say?"
"Never been there," repeated Arthur. "What are you talking about?
I have to go."
Agrajag stopped in his tracks.
"You must have been there. You were responsible for my death
there, as everywhere else. An innocent bystander!" He quivered.
"I've never heard of the place," insisted Arthur. "I've certainly
never had anyone try to assassinate me. Other than you. Perhaps I
go there later, do you think?"
Agrajag blinked slowly in a kind of frozen logical horror.
"You haven't been to Stavromula Beta ... yet?" he whispered.
"No," said Arthur, "I don't know anything about the place.
Certainly never been to it, and don't have any plans to go."
"Oh, you go there all right," muttered Agrajag in a broken voice,
"you go there all right. Oh zark!" he tottered, and stared wildly
about him at his huge Cathedral of Hate. "I've brought you here
too soon!"
He started to scream and bellow. "I've brought you here too
zarking soon!"
Suddenly he rallied, and turned a baleful, hating eye on Arthur.
"I'm going to kill you anyway!" he roared. "Even if it's a
logical impossibility I'm going to zarking well try! I'm going to
blow this whole mountain up!" He screamed, "Let's see you get out
of this one, Dent!"
He rushed in a painful waddling hobble to what appeared to be a
small black sacrificial altar. He was shouting so wildly now that
he was really carving his face up badly. Arthur leaped down from
his vantage place on the carving of his own foot and ran to try
to restrain the three-quarters-crazed creature.
He leaped upon him, and brought the strange monstrosity crashing
down on top of the altar.
Agrajag screamed again, thrashed wildly for a brief moment, and
turned a wild eye on Arthur.
"You know what you've done?" he gurgled painfully. "You've only
gone and killed me again. i mean, what do you want from me,
blood?"
He thrashed again in a brief apoplectic fit, quivered, and
collapsed, smacking a large red button on the altar as he did so.
Arthur started with horror and fear, first at what he appeared to
have done, and then at the loud sirens and bells that suddenly
shattered the air to announce some clamouring emergency. He
stared wildly around him.
The only exit appeared to be the way he came in. He pelted
towards it, throwing away the nasty fake leopard-skin bag as he
did so.
He dashed randomly, haphazardly through the labyrinthine maze, he
seemed to be pursued more and more fiercely by claxons, sirens,
flashing lights.
Suddenly, he turned a corner and there was a light in front of
him.
It wasn't flashing. It was daylight.
Although it has been said that on Earth alone in our Galaxy is
Krikkit (or cricket) treated as fit subject for a game, and that
for this reason the Earth has been shunned, this does only apply
to our Galaxy, and more specifically to our dimension. In some of
the higher dimensions they feel they can more or less please
themselves, and have been playing a peculiar game called Brockian
Ultra-Cricket for whatever their transdimensional equivalent of
billions of years is.
 "Let's be blunt, it's a nasty game" (says The Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy) "but then anyone who has been to any of the
higher dimensions will know that they're a pretty nasty heathen
lot up there who should just be smashed and done in, and would
be, too, if anyone could work out a way of firing missiles at
right-angles to reality."
This is another example of the fact that The Hitch Hiker's Guide
to the Galaxy will employ anybody who wants to walk straight in
off the street and get ripped off, especially if they happen to
walk in off the street during the afternoon, when very few of the
regular staff are there.
There is a fundamental point here.
The history of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is one of
idealism, struggle, despair, passion, success, failure, and
enormously long lunch-breaks.
The earliest origins of the Guide are now, along with most of its
financial records, lost in the mists of time.
For other, and more curious theories about where they are lost,
see below.
Most of the surviving stories, however, speak of a founding
editor called Hurling Frootmig.
Hurling Frootmig, it is said, founded the Guide, established its
fundamental principles of honesty and idealism, and went bust.
There followed many years of penury and heart-searching during
which he consulted friends, sat in darkened rooms in illegal
states of mind, thought about this and that, fooled about with
weights, and then, after a chance encounter with the Holy
Lunching Friars of Voondon (who claimed that just as lunch was at
the centre of a man's temporal day, and man's temporal day could
be seen as an analogy for his spiritual life, so Lunch should
(a) be seen as the centre of a man's spiritual life, and
(b) be held in jolly nice restaurants), he refounded the Guide,
laid down its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism and
where you could stuff them both, and led the Guide on to its
first major commercial success.
He also started to develop and explore the role of the editorial
lunch-break which was subsequently to play such a crucial part in
the Guide's history, since it meant that most of the actual work
got done by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the
empty offices on an afternoon and saw something worth doing.
Shortly after this, the Guide was taken over by Megadodo
Publications of Ursa Minor Beta, thus putting the whole thing on
a very sound financial footing, and allowing the fourth editor,
Lig Lury Jr, to embark on lunch-breaks of such breathtaking scope
that even the efforts of recent editors, who have started
undertaking sponsored lunch-breaks for charity, seem like mere
sandwiches in comparison.
In fact, Lig never formally resigned his editorship - he merely
left his office late one morning and has never since returned.
Though well over a century has now passed, many members of the
guide staff still retain the romantic notion that he has simply
popped out for a ham croissant, and will yet return to put in a
solid afternoon's work.
Strictly speaking, all editors since Lig Lury Jr have therefore
been designated Acting Editors, and Lig's desk is still preserved
the way he left it, with the addition of a small sign which says
"Lig Lury Jr, Editor, Missing, presumed Fed".
Some very scurrilous and subversive sources hint at the idea that
Lig actually perished in the Guide's first extraordinary
experiments in alternative book-keeping. Very little is known of
this, and less still said. Anyone who even notices, let alone
calls attention to, the curious but utter coincidental and
meaningless fact that every world on which the Guide has ever set
up an accounting department has shortly afterwards perished in
warfare or some natural disaster, is liable to get sued to
smithereens.
It is an interesting though utterly unrelated fact that the two
or three days prior to the demolition of the planet Earth to make
way for a new hyperspace bypass saw a dramatic upsurge in the
number of UFO sightings there, not only above Lords Cricket
Ground in St. John's Wood, London, but also above Glastonbury in
Somerset.
Glastonbury had long been associated with myths of ancient kings,
witchcraft, ley-lines an wart curing, and had now been selected
as the site for the new Hitch Hiker's Guide financial records
office, and indeed, ten years' worth of financial records were
transferred to a magic hill just outside the city mere hours
before the Vogons arrived.
None of these facts, however strange or inexplicable, is as
strange or inexplicable as the rules of the game of Brockian
Ultra-Cricket, as played in the higher dimensions. A full set of
rules is so massively complicated that the only time they were
all bound together in a single volume, they underwent
gravitational collapse and became a Black Hole.
A brief summary, however, is as follows:
Rule One: Grow at least three extra legs. You won't need them,
but it keeps the crowds amused.
Rule Two: Find one good Brockian Ultra-Cricket player. Clone him
off a few times. This saves an enormous amount of tedious
selection and training.
Rule Three: Put your team and the opposing team in a large field
and build a high wall round them.
The reason for this is that, though the game is a major spectator
sport, the frustration experienced by the audience at not
actually being able to see what's going on leads them to imagine
that it's a lot more exciting than it really is. A crowd that has
just watched a rather humdrum game experiences far less life-
affirmation than a crowd that believes it has just missed the
most dramatic event in sporting history.
Rule Four: Throw lots of assorted items of sporting equipment
over the wall for the players. Anything will do - cricket bats,
basecube bats, tennis guns, skis, anything you can get a good
swing with.
Rule Five: The players should now lay about themselves for all
they are worth with whatever they find to hand. Whenever a player
scores a "hit" on another player, he should immediately run away
and apologize from a safe distance.
Apologies should be concise, sincere and, for maximum clarity and
points, delivered through a megaphone.
Rule Six: The winning team shall be the first team that wins.
Curiously enough, the more the obsession with the game grows in
the higher dimensions, the less it is actually played, since most
of the competing teams are now in a state of permanent warfare
with each other over the interpretation of these rules. This is
all for the best, because in the long run a good solid war is
less psychologically damaging than a protracted game of Brockian
Ultra-Cricket.
As Arthur ran darting, dashing and panting down the side of the
mountain he suddenly felt the whole bulk of the mountain move
very, very slightly beneath him. There was a rumble, a roar, and
a slight blurred movement, and a lick of heat in the distance
behind and above him. He ran in a frenzy of fear. The land began
to slide, and he suddenly felt the force of the word "landslide"
in a way which had never been apparent to him before. It had
always just been a word to him, but now he was suddenly and
horribly aware that sliding is a strange and sickening thing for
land to do. It was doing it with him on it. He felt ill with fear
and shaking. The ground slid, the mountain slurred, he slipped,
he fell, he stood, he slipped again and ran. The avalance began.
Stones, then rocks, then boulders which pranced past him like
clumsy puppies, only much, much bigger, much, much harder and
heavier, and almost infinitely more likely to kill you if they
fell on you. His eyes danced with them, his feet danced with the
dancing ground. He ran as if running was a terrible sweating
sickness, his heart pounded to the rhythm of the pounding
geological frenzy around him.
The logic of the situation, i.e. that he was clearly bound to
survive if the next foreshadowed incident in the saga of his
inadvertent persecution of Agrajag was to happen, was utterly
failing to impinge itself on his mind or exercise any restraining
influence on him at this time. He ran with the fear of death in
him, under him, over him and grabbing hold of his hair.
And suddenly he tripped again and was hurled forward by his
considerable momentum. But just at the moment that he was about
to hit the ground astoundingly hard he saw lying directly in
front of him a small navy-blue holdall that he knew for a fact he
had lost in the baggage-retrieval system at Athens airport some
ten years in his personal time-scale previously, and in his
astonishment he missed the ground completely and bobbed off into
the air with his brain singing.
What he was doing was this: he was flying. He glanced around him
in surprise, but there could be no doubt that that was what he
was doing. No part of him was touching the ground, and no part of
him was even approaching it. He was simply floating there with
boulders hurtling through the air around him.
He could now do something about that. Blinking with the non-
effort of it he wafted higher into the air, and now the boulders
were hurtling through the air beneath him.
He looked downwards with intense curiosity. Between him and the
shivering ground were now some thirty feet of empty air, empty
that is if you discounted the boulders which didn't stay in it
for long, but bounded downwards in the iron grip of the law of
gravity; the same law which seemed, all of a sudden, to have
given Arthur a sabbatical.
It occurred to him almost instantly, with the instinctive
correctness that self-preservation instils in the mind, that he
mustn't try to think about it, that if he did, the law of gravity
would suddenly glance sharply in his direction and demand to know
what the hell he thought he was doing up there, and all would
suddenly be lost.
So he thought about tulips. It was difficult, but he did. He
thought about the pleasing firm roundness of the bottom of
tulips, he thought about the interesting variety of colours they
came in, and wondered what proportion of the total number of
tulips that grew, or had grown, on the Earth would be found
within a radius of one mile from a windmill. After a while he got
dangerously bored with this train of thought, felt the air
slipping away beneath him, felt that he was drifting down into
the paths of the bouncing boulders that he was trying so hard not
to think about, so he thought about Athens airport for a bit and
that kept him usefully annoyed for about five minutes - at the
end of which he was startled to discover that he was now floating
about two hundred yards above the ground.
He wondered for a moment how he was going to get back down to it,
but instantly shied away from that area of speculation again, and
tried to look at the situation steadily.
He was flying, What was he going to do about it? He looked back
down at the ground. He didn't look at it hard, but did his best
just to give it an idle glance, as it were, in passing. There
were a couple of things he couldn't help noticing. One was that
the eruption of the mountain seemed now to have spent itself -
there was a crater just a little way beneath the peak, presumably
where the rock had caved in on top of the huge cavernous
cathedral, the statue of himself, and the sadly abused figure of
Agrajag.
The other was his hold-all, the one he had lost at Athens
airport. It was sitting pertly on a piece of clear ground,
surrounded by exhausted boulders but apparently hit by none of
them. Why this should be he could not speculate, but since this
mystery was completely overshadowed by the monstrous
impossibility of the bag's being there in the first place, it was
not a speculation he really felt strong enough for anyway. The
thing is, it was there. And the nasty, fake leopard-skin bag
seemed to have disappeared, which was all to the good, if not
entirely to the explicable.
He was faced with the fact that he was going to have to pick the
thing up. Here he was, flying along two hundred yards above the
surface of an alien planet the name of which he couldn't even
remember. He could not ignore the plaintive posture of this tiny
piece of what used to be his life, here, so many light-years from
the pulverized remains of his home.
Furthermore, he realized, the bag, if it was still in the state
in which he lost it, would contain a can which would have in it
the only Greek olive oil still surviving in the Universe.
Slowly, carefully, inch by inch, he began to bob downwards,
swinging gently from side to side like a nervous sheet of paper
feeling its way towards the ground.
It went well, he was feeling good. The air supported him, but let
him through. Two minutes later he was hovering a mere two feet
above the bag, and was faced with some difficult decision. He
bobbed there lightly. He frowned, but again, as lightly as he
could.
If he picked the bag up, could he carry it? Mightn't the extra
weight just pull him straight to the ground?
Mightn't the mere act of touching something on the ground
suddenly discharge whatever mysterious force it was that was
holding him in the air?
Mightn't he be better off just being sensible at this point and
stepping out of the air, back on to the ground for a moment or
two?
If he did, would he ever be able to fly again?
The sensation, when he allowed himself to be aware of it, was so
quietly ecstatic that he could not bear the thought of losing it,
perhaps for ever. With this worry in mind he bobbed upwards a
little again, just to try the feel of it, the surprising and
effortless movement of it. He bobbed, he floated. He tried a
little swoop.
The swoop was terrific. With his arms spread out in front of him,
his hair and dressing gown streaming out behind him, he dived
down out of the sky, bellied along a body of air about two feet
from the ground and swung back up again, catching himself at the
top of the swing and holding. Just holding. He stayed there.
It was wonderful.
And that, he realized, was the way of picking up the bag. He
would swoop down and catch hold of it just at the point of the
upswing. He would carry it on up with him. He might wobble a bit,
but he was certain that he could hold it.
He tried one or two more practice swoops, and they got better and
better. The air on his face, the bounce and woof of his body, all
combined to make him feel an intoxication of the spirit that he
hadn't felt since, since - well as far as he could work out,
since he was born. He drifted away on the breeze and surveyed the
countryside, which was, he discovered, pretty nasty. It had a
wasted ravaged look. He decided not to look at it any more. He
would just pick up the bag and then ... he didn't know what he
was going to do after he had picked up the bag. He decided he
would just pick up the bag and see where things went from there.
He judged himself against the wind, pushed up against it and
turned around. He floated on its body. He didn't realize, but his
body was willoming at this point.
He ducked down under the airstream, dipped - and dived.
The air threw itself past him, he thrilled through it. The ground
wobbled uncertainly, straightened its ideas out and rose smoothly
up to meet him, offering the bag, its cracked plastic handles up
towards him.
Halfway down there was a sudden dangerous moment when he could no
longer believe he was doing this, and therefore he very nearly
wasn't, but he recovered himself in time, skimmed over the
ground, slipped an arm smoothly through the handles of the bag,
and began to climb back up, couldn't make it and all of a sudden
collapsed, bruised, scratched and shaking in the stony ground.
He staggered instantly to his feet and swayed hopelessly around,
swinging the bag round him in agony of grief and disappointment.
His feet, suddenly, were stuck heavily to the ground in the way
they always had been. His body seemed like an unwieldy sack of
potatoes that reeled stumbling against the ground, his mind had
all the lightness of a bag of lead.
He sagged and swayed and ached with giddiness. He tried
hopelessly to run, but his legs were suddenly too weak. He
tripped and flopped forward. At that moment he remembered that in
the bag he was now carrying was not only a can of Greek olive oil
but a duty-free allowance of retsina, and in the pleasurable
shock of that realization he failed to notice for at least ten
seconds that he was now flying again.
He whooped and cried with relief and pleasure, and sheer physical
delight. He swooped, he wheeled, he skidded and whirled through
the air. Cheekily he sat on an updraught and went through the
contents of the hold-all. He felt the way he imagined an angel
must feel during its celebrated dance on the head of a pin whilst
being counted by philosophers. He laughed with pleasure at the
discovery that the bag did in fact contain the olive oil and the
retsina as well as a pair of cracked sunglasses, some sand-filled
swimming trunks, some creased postcards of Santorini, a large and
unsightly towel, some interesting stones, and various scraps of
paper with the addresses of people he was relieved to think he
would never meet again, even if the reason why was a sad one. He
dropped the stones, put on the sunglasses, and let the pieces of
paper whip away in the wind.
Ten minutes later, drifting idly through a cloud, he got a large
and extremely disreputable cocktail party in the small of the
back.
The longest and most destructive party ever held is now into its
fourth generation, and still no one shows any signs of leaving.
Somebody did once look at his watch, but that was eleven years
ago, and there has been no follow-up.
The mess is extraordinary, and has to be seen to be believed, but
if you don't have any particular need to believe it, then don't
go and look, because you won't enjoy it.
There have recently been some bangs and flashes up in the clouds,
and there is one theory that this is a battle being fought
between the fleets of several rival carpet-cleaning companies who
are hovering over the thing like vultures, but you shouldn't
believe anything you hear at parties, and particularly not
anything you hear at this one.
One of the problems, and it's one which is obviously going to get
worse, is that all the people at the party are either the
children or the grandchildren or the great-grandchildren of the
people who wouldn't leave in the first place, and because of all
the business about selective breeding and regressive genes and so
on, it means that all the people now at the party are either
absolutely fanatical partygoers, or gibbering idiots, or, more
and more frequently, both.
Either way, it means that, genetically speaking, each succeeding
generation is now less likely to leave than the preceding one.
So other factors come into operation, like when the drink is
going to run out.
Now, because of certain things which have happened which seemed
like a good idea at the time (and one of the problems with a
party which never stops is that all the things which only seem
like a good idea at parties continue to seem like good ideas),
that point seems still to be a long way off.
One of the things which seemed like a good idea at the time was
that the party should fly - not in the normal sense that parties
are meant to fly, but literally.
One night, long ago, a band of drunken astro-engineers of the
first generation clambered round the building digging this,
fixing that, banging very hard on the other and when the sun rose
the following morning, it was startled to find itself shining on
a building full of happy drunken people which was now floating
like a young and uncertain bird over the treetops.
Not only that, but the flying party had also managed to arm
itself rather heavily. If they were going to get involved in any
petty arguments with wine merchants, they wanted to make sure
they had might on their side.
The transition from full-time cocktail party to part-time raiding
party came with ease, and did much to add that extra bit of zest
and swing to the whole affair which was badly needed at this
point because of the enormous number of times that the band had
already played all the numbers it knew over the years.
They looted, they raided, they held whole cities for ransom for
fresh supplies of cheese crackers, avocado dip, spare ribs and
wine and spirits, which would now get piped aboard from floating
tankers.
The problem of when the drink is going to run out is, however,
going to have to be faced one day.
The planet over which they are floating is no longer the planet
it was when they first started floating over it.
It is in bad shape.
The party had attacked and raided an awful lot of it, and no one
has ever succeeded in hitting it back because of the erratic and
unpredictable way in which it lurches round the sky.
It is one hell of a party.
It is also one hell of a thing to get hit by in the small of the
back.
 Arthur lay floundering in pain on a piece of ripped and
dismembered reinforced concrete, flicked at by wisps of passing
cloud and confused by the sounds of flabby merrymaking somewhere
indistinctly behind him.
There was a sound he couldn't immediately identify, partly
because he didn't know the tune "I Left my Leg in Jaglan Beta"
and partly because the band playing it were very tired, and some
members of it were playing it in three-four time, some in four-
four, and some in a kind of pie-eyed r, each according to the
amount of sleep he'd managed to grab recently.
He lay, panting heavily in the wet air, and tried feeling bits of
himself to see where he might be hurt. Wherever he touched
himself, he encountered a pain. After a short while he worked out
that this was because it was his hand that was hurting. He seemed
to have sprained his wrist. His back, too, was hurting, but he
soon satisfied himself that he was not badly hurt, but just
bruised and a little shaken, as who wouldn't be? He couldn't
understand what a building would be doing flying through the
clouds.
On the other hand, he would have been a little hard-pressed to
come up with any convincing explanation of his own presence, so
he decided that he and the building were just going to have to
accept each other. He looked up from where he was lying. A wall
of pale but stained stone slabs rose up behind him, the building
proper. He seemed to be stretched out on some sort of ledge or
lip which extended outwards for about three or four feet all the
way around. It was a hunk of the ground in which the party
building had had its foundations, and which it had taken along
with itself to keep itself bound together at the bottom end.
Nervously, he stood up and, suddenly, looking out over the edge,
he felt nauseous with vertigo. He pressed himself back against
the wall, wet with mist and sweat. His head was swimming
freestyle, but someone in his stomach was doing the butterfly.
Even though he had got up here under his own power, he could now
not even bear to contemplate the hideous drop in front of him. He
was not about to try his luck jumping. He was not about to move
an inch closer to the edge.
Clutching his hold-all he edged along the wall, hoping to find a
doorway in. The solid weight of the can of olive oil was a great
reassurance to him.
He was edging in the direction of the nearest corner, in the hope
that the wall around the corner might offer more in the way of
entrances than this one, which offered none.
The unsteadiness of the building's flight made him feel sick with
fear, and after a short while he took the towel from out of his
hold-all and did something with it which once again justified its
supreme position in the list of useful things to take with you
when you hitch-hike round the Galaxy. He put it over his head so
he wouldn't have to see what he was doing.
His feet edged along the ground. His outstretched hand edged
along the wall.
Finally he came to the corner, and as his hand rounded the corner
it encountered something which gave him such a shock that he
nearly fell straight off. It was another hand.
The two hands gripped each other.
He desperately wanted to use his other hand to pull the towel
back from his eyes, but it was holding the hold-all with the
olive oil, the retsina and the postcards from Santorini, and he
very much didn't want to put it down.
He experienced one of those "self" moments, one of those moments
when you suddenly turn around and look at yourself and think "Who
am I? What am I up to? What have I achieved? Am I doing well?" He
whimpered very slightly.
He tried to free his hand, but he couldn't. The other hand was
holding his tightly. He had no recourse but to edge onwards
towards the corner. He leaned around it and shook his head in an
attempt to dislodge the towel. This seemed to provoke a sharp cry
of some unfashionable emotion from the owner of the other hand.
The towel was whipped from his head and he found his eyes peering
into those of Ford Prefect. Beyond him stood Slartibartfast, and
beyond them he could clearly see a porchway and a large closed
door.
They were both pressed back against the wall, eyes wild with
terror as they stared out into the thick blind cloud around them,
and tried to resist the lurching and swaying of the building.
"Where the zarking photon have you been?" hissed Ford, panic
stricken.
"Er, well," stuttered Arthur, not really knowing how to sum it
all up that briefly. "Here and there. What are you doing here?"
Ford turned his wild eyes on Arthur again.
"They won't let us in without a bottle," he hissed.
The first thing Arthur noticed as they entered into the thick of
the party, apart from the noise, the suffocating heat, the wild
profusion of colours that protuded dimly through the atmosphere
of heavy smoke, the carpets thick with ground glass, ash and
avocado droppings, and the small group of pterodactyl-like
creatures in lurex who descended on his cherished bottle of
retsina, squawking, "A new pleasure, a new pleasure", was
Trillian being chatted up by a Thunder God.
"Didn't I see you at Milliways?" he was saying.
"Were you the one with the hammer?"
"Yes. I much prefer it here. So much less reputable, so much more
fraught."
Squeals of some hideous pleasure rang around the room, the outer
dimensions of which were invisible through the heaving throng of
happy, noisy creatures, cheerfully yelling things that nobody
could hear at each other and occasionally having crises.
"Seems fun," said Trillian. "What did you say, Arthur?"
"I said, how the hell did you get here?"
"I was a row of dots flowing randomly through the Universe. Have
you met Thor? He makes thunder."
"Hello," said Arthur. "I expect that must be very interesting."
"Hi," said Thor. "It is. Have you got a drink?"
"Er, no actually ..."
"Then why don't you go and get one?"
"See you later, Arthur," said Trillian.
Something jogged Arthur's mind, and he looked around huntedly.
"Zaphod isn't here, is he?" he said.
"See you," said Trillian firmly, "later."
Thor glared at him with hard coal-black eyes, his beard bristled,
what little light was there was in the place mustered its forces
briefly to glint menacingly off the horns of his helmet.
He took Trillian's elbow in his extremely large hand and the
muscles in his upper arm moved around each other like a couple of
Volkswagens parking.
He led her away.
"One of the interesting things about being immortal," he said,
"is ..."
"One of the interesting things about space," Arthur heard
Slartibartfast saying to a large and voluminous creature who
looked like someone losing a fight with a pink duvet and was
gazing raptly at the old man's deep eyes and silver beard, "is
how dull it is."
"Dull?" said the creature, and blinked her rather wrinkled and
bloodshot eyes.
"Yes," said Slartibartfast, "staggeringly dull. Bewilderingly so.
You see, there's so much of it and so little in it. Would you
like me to quote some statistics?"
"Er, well ..."
"Please, I would like to. They, too, are quite sensationally
dull."
"I'll come back and hear them in a moment," she said, patting him
on the arm, lifted up her skirts like a hovercraft and moved off
into the heaving crown.
"I thought she'd never go," growled the old man. "Come, Earthman
..."
"Arthur."
"We must find the Silver Bail, it is here somewhere."
"Can't we just relax a little?" Arthur said. "I've had a tough
day. Trillian's here, incidentally, she didn't say how, it
probably doesn't matter."
"Think of the danger to the Universe ..."
"The Universe," said Arthur, "is big enough and old enough to
look after itself for half an hour. All right," he added, in
response to Slartibartfast's increasing agitation, "I'll wander
round and see if anybody's seen it."
"Good, good," said Slartibartfast, "good. " He plunged into the
crowd himself, and was told to relax by everybody he passed.
"Have you seen a bail anywhere?" said Arthur to a little man who
seemed to be standing eagerly waiting to listen to somebody.
"It's made of silver, vitally important for the future safety of
the Universe, and about this long."
"No," said the enthusiastically wizened little man, "but do have
a drink and tell me all about it."
Ford Prefect writhed past, dancing a wild, frenetic and not
entirely unobscene dance with someone who looked as if she was
wearing Sydney Opera House on her head. He was yelling a futile
conversation at her above the din.
"I like that hat!" he bawled.
"What?"
"I said, I like the hat."
"I'm not wearing a hat."
"Well, I like the head, then."
"What?"
"I said, I like the head. Interesting bone-structure."
"What?"
Ford worked a shrug into the complex routine of other movements
he was performing.
"I said, you dance great," he shouted, "just don't nod so much."
"What?"
"It's just that every time you nod," said Ford, "... ow!" he
added as his partner nodded forward to say "What?" and once again
pecked him sharply on the forehead with the sharp end of her
swept-forward skull.
"My planet was blown up one morning," said Arthur, who had found
himself quite unexpectedly telling the little man his life story
or, at least, edited highlights of it, "that's why I'm dressed
like this, in my dressing gown. My planet was blown up with all
my clothes in it, you see. I didn't realize I'd be coming to a
party."
The little man nodded enthusiastically.
"Later, I was thrown off a spaceship. Still in my dressing gown.
Rather than the space suit one would normally expect. Shortly
after that I discovered that my planet had originally been built
for a bunch of mice. You can imagine how I felt about that. I was
then shot at for a while and blown up. In fact I have been blown
up ridiculously often, shot at, insulted, regularly
disintegrated, deprived of tea, and recently I crashed into a
swamp and had to spend five years in a damp cave."
"Ah," effervesced the little man, "and did you have a wonderful
time?"
Arthur started to choke violently on his drink.
"What a wonderful exciting cough," said the little man, quite
startled by it, "do you mind if I join you?"
And with that he launched into the most extraordinary and
spectacular fit of coughing which caught Arthur so much by
surprise that he started to choke violently, discovered he was
already doing it and got thoroughly confused.
Together they performed a lung-busting duet which went on for
fully two minutes before Arthur managed to cough and splutter to
a halt.
"So invigorating," said the little man, panting and wiping tears
from his eyes. "What an exciting life you must lead. Thank you
very much."
He shook Arthur warmly by the hand and walked off into the crowd.
Arthur shook his head in astonishment.
A youngish-looking man came up to him, an aggressive-looking type
with a hook mouth, a lantern nose, and small beady little
cheekbones. He was wearing black trousers, a black silk shirt
open to what was presumably his navel, though Arthur had learnt
never to make assumptions about the anatomies of the sort of
people he tended to meet these days, and had all sorts of nasty
dangly gold things hanging round his neck. He carried something
in a black bag, and clearly wanted people to notice that he
didn't want them to notice it.
"Hey, er, did I hear you say your name just now?" he said.
This was one of the many things that Arthur had told the
enthusiastic little man.
"Yes, it's Arthur Dent."
The man seemed to be dancing slightly to some rhythm other than
any of the several that the band were grimly pushing out.
"Yeah," he said, "only there was a man in a mountain wanted to
see you."
"I met him."
"Yeah, only he seemed pretty anxious about it, you know."
"Yes, I met him."
"Yeah, well I think you should know that."
"I do. I met him."
The man paused to chew a little gum. Then he clapped Arthur on
the back.
"OK," he said, "all right. I'm just telling you, right? Good
night, good luck, win awards."
"What?" said Arthur, who was beginning to flounder seriously at
this point.
"Whatever. Do what you do. Do it well." He made a sort of
clucking noise with whatever he was chewing and then some vaguely
dynamic gesture.
"Why?" said Arthur.
"Do it badly," said the man, "who cares? Who gives a shit?" The
blood suddenly seemed to pump angrily into the man's face and he
started to shout.
"Why not go mad?" he said. "Go away, get off my back will you,
guy. Just zark off!!!"
"OK, I'm going," said Arthur hurriedly.
"It's been real." The man gave a sharp wave and disappeared off
into the throng.
"What was that about?" said Arthur to a girl he found standing
beside him. "Why did he tell me to win awards?"
"Just showbiz talk," shrugged the girl. "He's just won an award
at the Annual Ursa Minor Alpha Recreational Illusions Institute
Awards Ceremony, and was hoping to be able to pass it off
lightly, only you didn't mention it, so he couldn't."
"Oh," said Arthur, "oh, well I'm sorry I didn't. What was it
for?"
"The Most Gratuitous Use Of The Word Fuck' In A Serious
Screenplay. It's very prestigious."
"I see," said Arthur, "yes, and what do you get for that?"
"A Rory. It's just a small silver thing set on a large black
base. What did you say?"
"I didn't say anything. I was just about to ask what the silver
..."
"Oh, I thought you said wop'."
"Said what?"
"Wop."
People had been dropping in on the party now for some years,
fashionable gatecrashers from other worlds, and for some time it
had occurred to the partygoers as they had looked out at their
own world beneath them, with its wrecked cities, its ravaged
avocado farms and blighted vineyards, its vast tracts of new
desert, its seas full of biscuit crumbs and worse, that their
world was in some tiny and almost imperceptible ways not quite as
much fun as it had been. Some of them had begun to wonder if they
could manage to stay sober for long enough to make the entire
party spaceworthy and maybe take it off to some other people's
worlds where the air might be fresher and give them fewer
headaches.
The few undernourished farmers who still managed to scratch out a
feeble existence on the half-dead ground of the planet's surface
would have been extremely pleased to hear this, but that day, as
the party came screaming out of the clouds and the farmers looked
up in haggard fear of yet another cheese-and-wine raid, it became
clear that the party was not going to be going anywhere else for
a while, that the party would soon be over. Very soon it would be
time to gather up hats and coats and stagger blearily outside to
find out what time of day it was, what time of year it was, and
whether in any of this burnt and ravaged land there was a taxi
going anywhere.
The party was locked in a horrible embrace with a strange white
spaceship which seemed to be half sticking through it. Together
they were lurching, heaving and spinning their way round the sky
in grotesque disregard of their own weight.
The clouds parted. The air roared and leapt out of their way.
The party and the Krikkit warship looked, in their writhings, a
little like two ducks, one of which is trying to make a third
duck inside the second duck, whilst the second duck is trying
very hard to explain that it doesn't feel ready for a third duck
right now, is uncertain that it would want any putative third
duck to be made by this particular first duck anyway, and
certainly not whilst it, the second duck, was busy flying.
The sky sang and screamed with the rage of it all and buffeted
the ground with shock waves.
And suddenly, with a foop, the Krikkit ship was gone.
The party blundered helplessly across the sky like a man leaning
against an unexpectedly open door. It span and wobbled on its
hover jets. It tried to right itself and wronged itself instead.
It staggered back across the sky again.
For a while these staggerings continued, but clearly they could
not continue for long. The party was now a mortally wounded
party. All the fun had gone out of it, as the occasional broken-
backed pirouette could not disguise.
The longer, at this point, that it avoided the ground, the
heavier was going to be the crash when finally it hit it.
Inside, things were not going well either. They were going
monstrously badly, in fact, and people were hating it and saying
so loudly. The Krikkit robots had been.
They had removed the Award for The Most Gratuitous Use Of The
Word Fuck' In A Serious Screenplay, and in its place had left a
scene of devastation that left Arthur feeling almost as sick as a
runner-up for a Rory.
"We would love to stay and help," shouted Ford, picking his way
over the mangled debris, "only we're not going to."
The party lurched again, provoking feverish cries and groans from
amongst the smoking wreckage.
"We have to go and save the Universe, you see," said Ford. "And
if that sounds like a pretty lame excuse, then you may be right.
Either way, we're off."
He suddenly came across an unopened bottle lying, miraculously
unbroken, on the ground.
"Do you mind if we take this?" he said. "You won't be needing
it."
He took a packet of potato crisps too.
"Trillian?" shouted Arthur in a shocked and weakened voice. In
the smoking mess he could see nothing.
"Earthman, we must go," said Slartibartfast nervously.
"Trillian?" shouted Arthur again.
A moment or two later, Trillian staggered, shaking, into view,
supported by her new friend the Thunder God.
"The girl stays with me," said Thor. "There's a great party going
on in Valhalla, we'll be flying off ..."
"Where were you when all this was going on?" said Arthur.
"Upstairs," said Thor, "I was weighing her. Flying's a tricky
business you see, you have to calculate wind ..."
"She comes with us," said Arthur.
"Hey," said Trillian, "don't I ..."
"No," said Arthur, "you come with us."
Thor looked at him with slowly smouldering eyes. He was making
some point about godliness and it had nothing to do with being
clean.
"She comes with me," he said quietly.
"Come on, Earthman," said Slartibartfast nervously, picking at
Arthur's sleeve.
"Come on, Slartibartfast," said Ford, picking at the old man's
sleeve. Slartibartfast had the teleport device.
The party lurched and swayed, sending everyone reeling, except
for Thor and except for Arthur, who stared, shaking, into the
Thunder God's black eyes.
Slowly, incredibly, Arthur put up what appeared to be his tiny
little fists.
"Want to make something of it?" he said.
"I beg your minuscule pardon?" roared Thor.
"I said," repeated Arthur, and he could not keep the quavering
out of his voice, "do you want to make something of it?" He
waggled his fists ridiculously.
Thor looked at him with incredulity. Then a little wisp of smoke
curled upwards from his nostril. There was a tiny little flame in
it too.
He gripped his belt.
He expanded his chest to make it totally clear that here was the
sort of man you only dared to cross if you had a team of Sherpas
with you.
He unhooked the shaft of his hammer from his belt. He held it up
in his hands to reveal the massive iron head. He thus cleared up
any possible misunderstanding that he might merely have been
carrying a telegraph pole around with him.
"Do I want," he said, with a hiss like a river flowing through a
steel mill, "to make something of it?"
"Yes," said Arthur, his voice suddenly and extraordinarily strong
and belligerent. He waggled his fists again, this time as if he
meant it.
"You want to step outside?" he snarled at Thor.
"All right!" bellowed Thor, like an enraged bull (or in fact like
an enraged Thunder God, which is a great deal more impressive),
and did so.
"Good," said Arthur, "that's got rid of him. Slarty, get us out
of here."
"All right," shouted Ford at Arthur, "so I'm a coward, the point
is I'm still alive." They were back aboard the Starship
Bistromath, so was Slartibartfast, so was Trillian. Harmony and
concord were not.
"Well, so am I alive, aren't I?" retaliated Arthur, haggard with
adventure and anger. His eyebrows were leaping up and down as if
they wanted to punch each other.
"You damn nearly weren't," exploded Ford.
Arthur turned sharply to Slartibartfast, who was sitting in his
pilot couch on the flight deck gazing thoughtfully into the
bottom of a bottle which was telling him something he clearly
couldn't fathom. He appealed to him.
"Do you think he understands the first word I've been saying?" he
said, quivering with emotion.
"I don't know," replied Slartibartfast, a little abstractedly.
"I'm not sure," he added, glancing up very briefly, "that I do."
He stared at his instruments with renewed vigor and bafflement.
"You'll have to explain it to us again," he said.
"Well ..."
"But later. Terrible things are afoot."
He tapped the pseudo-glass of the bottle bottom.
"We fared rather pathetically at the party, I'm afraid," he said,
"and our only hope now is to try to prevent the robots from using
the Key in the Lock. How in heaven we do that I don't know," he
muttered. "Just have to go there, I suppose. Can't say I like the
idea at all. Probably end up dead."
"Where is Trillian anyway?" said Arthur with a sudden affectation
of unconcern. What he had been angry about was that Ford had
berated him for wasting time over all the business with the
Thunder God when they could have been making a rather more rapid
escape. Arthur's own opinion, and he had offered it for whatever
anybody might have felt it was worth, was that he had been
extraordinarily brave and resourceful.
The prevailing view seemed to be that his opinion was not worth a
pair of fetid dingo's kidneys. What really hurt, though, was that
Trillian didn't seem to react much one way or the other and had
wandered off somewhere.
"And where are my potato crisps?" said Ford.
"They are both," said Slartibartfast, without looking up, "in the
Room of Informational Illusions. I think that your young lady
friend is trying to understand some problems of Galactic history.
I think the potato crisps are probably helping her."
It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just
with potatoes.
For instance, there was once an insanely aggressive race of
people called the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax. That was
just the name of their race. The name of their army was something
quite horrific. Luckily they lived even further back in Galactic
history than anything we have so far encountered - twenty billion
years ago - when the Galaxy was young and fresh, and every idea
worth fighting for was a new one.
And fighting was what the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax were
good at, and being good at it, they did a lot. They fought their
enemies (i.e. everybody else), they fought each other. Their
planet was a complete wreck. The surface was littered with
abandoned cities which were surrounded by abandoned war machines,
which were in turn surrounded by deep bunkers in which the
Silastic Armorfiends lived and squabbled with each other.
The best way to pick a fight with a Silastic Armorfiend was just
to be born. They didn't like it, they got resentful. And when an
Armorfiend got resentful, someone got hurt. An exhausting way of
life, one might think, but they did seem to have an awful lot of
energy.
The best way of dealing with a Silastic Armorfiend was to put him
into a room of his own, because sooner or later he would simply
beat himself up.
Eventually they realized that this was something they were going
to have to sort out, and they passed a law decreeing that anyone
who had to carry a weapon as part of his normal Silastic work
(policemen, security guards, primary school teachers, etc.) had
to spend at least forty-five minutes every day punching a sack of
potatoes in order to work off his or her surplus aggressions.
For a while this worked well, until someone thought that it would
be much more efficient and less time-consuming if they just shot
the potatoes instead.
This led to a renewed enthusiasm for shooting all sorts of
things, and they all got very excited at the prospect of their
first major war for weeks.
Another achievement of the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax is
that they were the first race who ever managed to shock a
computer.
It was a gigantic spaceborne computer called Hactar, which to
this day is remembered as one of the most powerful ever built. It
was the first to be built like a natural brain, in that every
cellular particle of it carried the pattern of the whole within
it, which enabled it to think more flexibly and imaginatively,
and also, it seemed, to be shocked.
The Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax were engaged in one of
their regular wars with the Strenuous Garfighters of Stug, and
were not enjoying it as much as usual because it involved an
awful lot of trekking through the Radiation Swamps of Cwulzenda,
and across the Fire Mountains of Frazfraga, neither of which
terrains they felt at home in.
So when the Strangulous Stilettans of Jajazikstak joined in the
fray and forced them to fight another front in the Gamma Caves of
Carfrax and the Ice Storms of Varlengooten, they decided that
enough was enough, and they ordered Hactar to design for them an
Ultimate Weapon.
"What do you mean," asked Hactar, "by Ultimate?"
To which the Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax said, "Read a
bloody dictionary," and plunged back into the fray.
So Hactar designed an Ultimate Weapon.
It was a very, very small bomb which was simply a junction box in
hyperspace that would, when activated, connect the heart of every
major sun with the heart of every other major sun simultaneously
and thus turn the entire Universe in to one gigantic hyperspatial
supernova.
When the Silastic Armorfiends tried to use it to blow up a
Strangulous Stilettan munitions dump in one of the Gamma Caves,
they were extremely irritated that it didn't work, and said so.
Hactar had been shocked by the whole idea.
He tried to explain that he had been thinking about this Ultimate
Weapon business, and had worked out that there was no conceivable
consequence of not setting the bomb off that was worse than the
known consequence of setting it off, and he had therefore taken
the liberty of introducing a small flaw into the design of the
bomb, and he hoped that everyone involved would, on sober
reflection, feel that ...
The Silastic Armorfiends disagreed and pulverized the computer.
Later they thought better of it, and destroyed the faulty bomb as
well.
Then, pausing only to smash the hell out of the Strenuous
Garfighters of Stug, and the Strangulous Stilettans of
Jajazikstak, they went on to find an entirely new way of blowing
themselves up, which was a profound relief to everyone else in
the Galaxy, particularly the Garfighters, the Stilettans and the
potatoes.
Trillian had watched all this, as well as the story of Krikkit.
She emerged from the Room of informational Illusions
thoughtfully, just in time to discover that they had arrived too
late.
Even as the Starship Bistromath flickered into objective being on
the top of a small cliff on the mile-wide asteroid which pursued
a lonely and eternal path in orbit around the enclosed star
system of Krikkit, its crew was aware that they were in time only
to be witnesses to an unstoppable historic event.
They didn't realize they were going to see two.
They stood cold, lonely and helpless on the cliff edge and
watched the activity below. Lances of light wheeled in sinister
arcs against the void from a point only about a hundred yards
below and in front of them.
They stared into the blinding event.
An extension of the ship's field enabled them to stand there, by
once again exploiting the mind's predisposition to have tricks
played on it: the problems of falling up off the tiny mass of the
asteroid, or of not being able to breathe, simply became Somebody
Else's.
The white Krikkit warship was parked amongst the stark grey crags
of the asteroid, alternately flaring under arclights or
disappearing in shadow. The blackness of the shaped shadows cast
by the hard rocks danced together in wild choreography as the
arclights swept round them.
The eleven white robots were bearing, in procession, the Wikkit
Key out into the middle of a circle of swinging lights.
The Wikkit Key was rebuilt. Its components shone and glittered:
the Steel Pillar (or Marvin's leg) of Strength and Power, the
Gold Bail (or Heart of the Improbability Drive) of Prosperity,
the Perspex Pillar (or Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice) of Science
and Reason, the Silver Bail (or Rory Award for The Most
Gratuitous Use Of The Word "Fuck" In A Serious Screenplay) and
the now reconstituted Wooden Pillar (or Ashes of a burnt stump
signifying the death of English cricket) of Nature and
Spirituality.
"I suppose there is nothing we can do at this point?" asked
Arthur nervously.
"No," sighed Slartibartfast.
The expression of disappointment which crossed Arthur's face was
a complete failure, and, since he was standing obscured by
shadow, he allowed it to collapse into one of relief.
"Pity," he said.
"We have no weapons," said Slartibartfast, "stupidly."
"Damn," said Arthur very quietly.
Ford said nothing.
Trillian said nothing, but in a peculiarly thoughtful and
distinct way. She was staring at the blankness of the space
beyond the asteroid.
The asteroid circled the Dust Cloud which surrounded the Slo-Time
envelope which enclosed the world on which lived the people of
Krikkit, the Masters of Krikkit and their killer robots.
The helpless group had no way of knowing whether or not the
Krikkit robots were aware of their presence. They could only
assume that they must be, but that they felt, quite rightly in
the circumstances, that they had nothing to fear. They had an
historic task to perform, and their audience could be regarded
with contempt.
"Terrible impotent feeling, isn't it?" said Arthur, but the
others ignored him.
In the centre of the area of light which the robots were
approaching, a square-shaped crack appeared in the ground. The
crack defined itself more and more distinctly, and soon it became
clear that a block of the ground, about six feet square, was
slowly rising.
At the same time they became aware of some other movement, but it
was almost sublimal, and for a moment or two it was not clear
what it was that was moving.
Then it became clear.
The asteroid was moving. It was moving slowly in towards the Dust
Cloud, as if being hauled in inexorably by some celestial angler
in its depths.
They were to make in real life the journey through the Cloud
which they had already made in the Room of Informational
Illusions. They stood frozen in silence. Trillian frowned.
An age seemed to pass. Events seemed to pass with spinning
slowness, as the leading edge of the asteroid passed into the
vague and soft outer perimeter of the Cloud.
And soon they were engulfed in a thin and dancing obscurity. They
passed on through it, on and on, dimly aware of vague shapes and
whorls indistinguishable in the darkness except in the corner of
the eye.
The Dust dimmed the shafts of brilliant light. The shafts of
brilliant light twinkled on the myriad specks of Dust.
Trillian, again, regarded the passage from within her own
frowning thoughts.
And they were through it. Whether it had taken a minute or half
an hour they weren't sure, but they were through it and
confronted with a fresh blankness, as if space were pinched out
of existence in front of them.
And now things moved quickly.
A blinding shaft of light seemed almost to explode from out of
the block which had risen three feet out of the ground, and out
of that rose a smaller Perspex block, dazzling with interior
dancing colours.
The block was slotted with deep groves, three upright and two
across, clearly designed to accept the Wikkit key.
The robots approached the Lock, slotted the Key into its home and
stepped back again. The block twisted round of is own accord, and
space began to alter.
As space unpinched itself, it seemed agonizingly to twist the
eyes of the watchers in their sockets. They found themselves
staring, blinded, at an unravelled sun which stood now before
them where it seemed only seconds before there had not been even
empty space. It was a second or two before they were even
sufficiently aware of what had happened to throw their hands up
over their horrified blinded eyes. In that second or two, they
were aware of a tiny speck moving slowly across the eye of that
sun.
They staggered back, and heard ringing in their ears the thin and
unexpected chant of the robots crying out in unison.
"Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit! Krikkit!"
The sound chilled them. It was harsh, it was cold, it was empty,
it was mechanically dismal.
It was also triumphant.
They were so stunned by these two sensory shocks that they almost
missed the second historic event.
Zaphod Beeblebrox, the only man in history to survive a direct
blast attack from the Krikkit robots, ran out of the Krikkit
warship brandishing a Zap gun.
"OK," he cried, "the situation is totally under control as of
this moment in time."
The single robot guarding the hatchway to the ship silently swung
his battleclub, and connected it with the back of Zaphod's left
head.
"Who the zark did that?" said the left head, and lolled
sickeningly forward.
His right head gazed keenly into the middle distance.
"Who did what?" it said.
The club connected with the back of his right head.
Zaphod measured his length as a rather strange shape on the
ground.
Within a matter of seconds the whole event was over. A few blasts
from the robots were sufficient to destroy the Lock for ever. It
split and melted and splayed its contents brokenly. The robots
marched grimly and, it almost seemed, in a slightly disheartened
manner, back into their warship which, with a "foop", was gone.
Trillian and Ford ran hectically round and down the steep incline
to the dark, still body of Zaphod Beeblebrox.
"I don't know," said Zaphod, for what seemed to him like the
thirty-seventh time, "they could have killed me, but they didn't.
Maybe they just thought I was a kind of wonderful guy or
something. I could understand that."
The others silently registered their opinions of this theory.
Zaphod lay on the cold floor of the flight deck. His back seemed
to wrestle the floor as pain thudded through him and banged at
his heads.
"I think," he whispered, "that there is something wrong with
those anodized dudes, something fundamentally weird."
"They are programmed to kill everybody," Slartibartfast pointed
out.
"That," wheezed Zaphod between the whacking thuds, "could be it."
He didn't seem altogether convinced.
"Hey, baby," he said to Trillian, hoping this would make up for
his previous behaviour.
"You all right?" she said gently.
"Yeah," he said, "I'm fine."
"Good," she said, and walked away to think. She stared at the
huge visiscreen over the flight couches and, twisting a switch,
she flipped local images over it. One image was the blankness of
the Dust Cloud. One was the sun of Krikkit. One was Krikkit
itself. She flipped between them fiercely.
"Well, that's goodbye Galaxy, then," said Arthur, slapping his
knees and standing up.
"No," said Slartibartfast, gravely. "Our course is clear." He
furrowed his brow until you could grow some of the smaller root
vegetables in it. He stood up, he paced around. When he spoke
again, what he said frightened him so much he had to sit down
again.
"We must go down to Krikkit," he said. A deep sigh shook his old
frame and his eyes seemed almost to rattle in their sockets.
"Once again," he said, "we have failed pathetically. Quite
pathetically."
"That," said Ford quietly, "is because we don't care enough. I
told you."
He swung his feet up on the instrument panel and picked fitfully
at something on one of his fingernails.
"But unless we determine to take action," said the old man
querulously, as if struggling against something deeply insouciant
in his nature, "then we shall all be destroyed, we shall all die.
Surely we care about that?"
"Not enough to want to get killed over it," said Ford. He put on
a sort of hollow smile and flipped it round the room at anyone
who wanted to see it.
Slartibartfast clearly found this point of view extremely
seductive and he fought against it. He turned again to Zaphod who
was gritting his teeth and sweating with the pain.
"You surely must have some idea," he said, "of why they spared
your life. It seems most strange and unusual."
"I kind of think they didn't even know," shrugged Zaphod. "I told
you. They hit me with the most feeble blast, just knocked me out,
right? They lugged me into their ship, dumped me into a corner
and ignored me. Like they were embarrassed about me being there.
If I said anything they knocked me out again. We had some great
conversations. Hey ... ugh!' Hi there ... ugh!' I wonder
...ugh!' Kept me amused for hours, you know." He winced again.
He was toying with something in his fingers. He held it up. It
was the Gold Bail - the Heart of Gold, the heart of the Infinite
Improbability Drive. Only that and the Wooden Pillar had survived
the destruction of the Lock intact.
"I hear your ship can move a bit," he said. "So how would you
like to zip me back to mine before you ..."
"Will you not help us?" said Slartibartfast.
"I'd love to stay and help you save the Galaxy," insisted Zaphod,
rising himself up on to his shoulders, "but I have the mother and
father of a pair of headaches, and I feel a lot of little
headaches coming on. But next time it needs saving, I'm your guy.
Hey, Trillian baby?"
She looked round briefly.
"Yes?"
"You want to come? Heart of Gold? Excitement and adventure and
really wild things?"
"I'm going down to Krikkit," she said.
It was the same hill, and yet not the same.
This time it was not an Informational Illusion. This was Krikkit
itself and they were standing on it. Near them, behind the trees,
stood the strange Italian restaurant which had brought these,
their real bodies, to this, the real, present world of Krikkit.
The strong grass under their feet was real, the rich soil real
too. The heady fragrances from the tree, too, were real. The
night was real night.
Krikkit.
Possibly the most dangerous place in the Galaxy for anyone who
isn't a Krikkiter to stand. The place that could not countenance
the existence of any other place, whose charming, delightful,
intelligent inhabitants would howl with fear, savagery and
murderous hate when confronted with anyone not their own.
Arthur shuddered.
Slartibartfast shuddered.
Ford, surprisingly, shuddered.
It was not surprising that he shuddered, it was surprising that
he was there at all. But when they had returned Zaphod to his
ship Ford had felt unexpectedly shamed into not running away.
Wrong, he thought to himself, wrong wrong wrong. He hugged to
himself one of the Zap guns with which they had armed themselves
out of Zaphod's armoury.
Trillian shuddered, and frowned as she looked into the sky.
This, too, was not the same. It was no longer blank and empty.
Whilst the countryside around them had changed little in the two
thousand years of the Krikkit wars, and the mere five years that
had elapsed locally since Krikkit was sealed in its Slo-Time
envelope ten billion years ago, the sky was dramatically
different.
Dim lights and heavy shapes hung in it.
High in the sky, where no Krikkiter ever looked, were the War
Zones, the Robot Zones - huge warships and tower blocks floating
in the Nil-O-Grav fields far above the idyllic pastoral lands of
the surface of Krikkit.
Trillian stared at them and thought.
"Trillian," whispered Ford Prefect to her.
"Yes?" she said.
"What are you doing?"
"Thinking."
"Do you always breathe like that when you're thinking?"
"I wasn't aware that I was breathing."
"That's what worried me."
"I think I know ..." said Trillian.
"Shhhh!" said Slartibartfast in alarm, and his thin trembling
hand motioned them further back beneath the shadow of the tree.
Suddenly, as before in the tape, there were lights coming along
the hill path, but this time the dancing beams were not from
lanterns but electric torches - not in itself a dramatic change,
but every detail made their hearts thump with fear. This time
there were no lilting whimsical songs about flowers and farming
and dead dogs, but hushed voices in urgent debate.
A light moved in the sky with slow weight. Arthur was clenched
with a claustrophobic terror and the warm wind caught at his
throat.
Within seconds a second party became visible, approaching from
the other side of the dark hill. They were moving swiftly and
purposefully, their torches swinging and probing around them.
The parties were clearly converging, and not merely with each
other. They were converging deliberately on the spot where Arthur
and the others were standing.
Arthur heard the slight rustle as Ford Prefect raised his Zap gun
to his shoulder, and the slight whimpering cough as
Slartibartfast raised his. He felt the cold unfamiliar weight of
his own gun, and with shaking hands he raised it.
His fingers fumbled to release the safety catch and engage the
extreme danger catch as Ford had shown him. He was shaking so
much that if he'd fired at anybody at that moment he probably
would have burnt his signature on them.
Only Trillian didn't raise her gun. She raised her eyebrows,
lowered them again, and bit her lip in thought.
"Has it occurred to you," she began, but nobody wanted to discuss
anything much at the moment.
A light stabbed through the darkness from behind them and they
span around to find a third party of Krikkiters behind them,
searching them out with their torches.
Ford Prefect's gun crackled viciously, but fire spat back at it
and it crashed from his hands.
There was a moment of pure fear, a frozen second before anyone
fired again.
And at the end of the second nobody fired.
They were surrounded by pale-faced Krikkiters and bathed in
bobbing torch light.
The captives stared at their captors, the captors stared at their
captives.
"Hello?" said one of the captors. "Excuse me, but are you ...
aliens?"
Meanwhile, more millions of miles away than the mind can
comfortably encompass, Zaphod Beeblebrox was throwing a mood
again.
He had repaired his ship - that is, he'd watched with alert
interest whilst a service robot had repaired it for him. It was
now, once again, one of the most powerful and extraordinary ships
in existence. He could go anywhere, do anything. He fiddled with
a book, and then tossed it away. It was the one he'd read before.
He walked over to the communications bank and opened an all-
frequencies emergency channel.
"Anyone want a drink?" he said.
"This an emergency, feller?" crackled a voice from halfway across
the Galaxy.
"Got any mixers?" said Zaphod.
"Go take a ride on a comet."
"OK, OK," said Zaphod and flipped the channel shut again. He
sighed and sat down. He got up again and wandered over to a
computer screen. He pushed a few buttons. Little blobs started to
rush around the screen eating each other.
"Pow!" said Zaphod. "Freeeoooo! Pop pop pop!"
"Hi there," said the computer brightly after a minute of this,
"you have scored three points. Previous best score, seven million
five hundred and ninety-seven thousand, two hundred and ..."
"OK, OK," said Zaphod and flipped the screen blank again.
He sat down again. He played with a pencil. This too began slowly
to lose its fascination.
"OK, OK," he said, and fed his score and the previous one into
the computer.
His ship made a blur of the Universe.
"Tell us," said the thin, pale-faced Krikkiter who had stepped
forward from the ranks of the others and stood uncertainly in the
circle of torchlight, handling his gun as if he was just holding
it for someone else who'd just popped off somewhere but would be
back in a minute, "do you know anything about something called
the Balance of Nature?"
There was no reply from their captives, or at least nothing more
articulate than a few confused mumbles and grunts. The torchlight
continued to play over them. High in the sky above them dark
activity continued in the Robot zones.
"It's just," continued the Krikkiter uneasily, "something we
heard about, probably nothing important. Well, I suppose we'd
better kill you then."
He looked down at his gun as if he was trying to find which bit
to press.
"That is," he said, looking up again, "unless there's anything
you want to chat about?"
Slow, numb astonishment crept up the bodies of Slartibartfast,
Ford and Arthur. Very soon it would reach their brains, which
were at the moment solely occupied with moving their jawbones up
and down. Trillian was shaking her head as if trying to finish a
jigsaw by shaking the box.
"We're worried, you see," said another man from the crowd, "about
this plan of universal destruction."
"Yes," added another, "and the balance of nature. It just seemed
to us that if the whole of the rest of the Universe is destroyed
it will somehow upset the balance of nature. We're quite keen on
ecology, you see." His voice trailed away unhappily.
"And sport," said another, loudly. This got a cheer of approval
from the others.
"Yes," agreed the first, "and sport ..." He looked back at his
fellows uneasily and scratched fitfully at his cheek. He seemed
to be wrestling with some deep inner confusion, as if everything
he wanted to say and everything he thought were entirely
different things, between which he could see no possible
connection.
"You see," he mumbled, "some of us ..." and he looked around
again as if for confirmation. The others made encouraging noises.
"Some of us," he continued, "are quite keen to have sporting
links with the rest of the Galaxy, and though I can see the
argument about keeping sport out of politics, I think that if we
want to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy, which we
do, then it's probably a mistake to destroy it. And indeed the
rest of the Universe ..." his voice trailed away again "... which
is what seems to be the idea now ..."
"Wh ..." said Slartibartfast. "Wh ..."
"Hhhh ... ?" said Arthur.
"Dr ..." said Ford Prefect.
"OK," said Trillian. "Let's talk about it." She walked forward
and took the poor confused Krikkiter by the arm. He looked about
twenty-five, which meant, because of the peculiar manglings of
time that had been going on in this area, that he would have been
just twenty when the Krikkit Wars were finished, ten billion
years ago.
Trillian led him for a short walk through the torchlight before
she said anything more. He stumbled uncertainly after her. The
encircling torch beams were drooping now slightly as if they were
abdicating to this strange, quiet girl who alone in the Universe
of dark confusion seemed to know what she was doing.
She turned and faced him, and lightly held both his arms. He was
a picture of bewildered misery.
"Tell me," she said.
He said nothing for a moment, whilst his gaze darted from one of
her eyes to the other.
"We ..." he said, "we have to be alone ... I think." He screwed
up his face and then dropped his head forward, shaking it like
someone trying to shake a coin out of a money box. He looked up
again. "We have this bomb now, you see," he said, "it's just a
little one."
"I know," she said.
He goggled at her as if she'd said something very strange about
beetroots.
"Honestly," he said, "it's very, very little."
"I know," she said again.
"But they say," his voice trailed on, "they say it can destroy
everything that exists. And we have to do that, you see, I think.
Will that make us alone? I don't know. It seems to be our
function, though," he said, and dropped his head again.
"Whatever that means," said a hollow voice from the crowd.
Trillian slowly put her arms around the poor bewildered young
Krikkiter and patted his trembling head on her shoulder.
"It's all right," she said quietly but clearly enough for all the
shadowy crowd to hear, "you don't have to do it."
She rocked him.
"You don't have to do it," she said again.
She let him go and stood back.
"I want you to do something for me," she said, and unexpectedly
laughed.
"I want," she said, and laughed again. She put her hand over her
mouth and then said with a straight face, "I want you to take me
to your leader," and she pointed into the War Zones in the sky.
She seemed somehow to know that their leader would be there.
Her laughter seemed to discharge something in the atmosphere.
From somewhere at the back of the crowd a single voice started to
sing a tune which would have enabled Paul McCartney, had he
written it, to buy the world.
Zaphod Beeblebrox crawled bravely along a tunnel, like the hell
of a guy he was. He was very confused, but continued crawling
doggedly anyway because he was that brave.
He was confused by something he had just seen, but not half as
confused as he was going to be by something he was about to hear,
so it would now be best to explain exactly where he was.
He was in the Robot War Zones many miles above the surface of the
planet Krikkit.
The atmosphere was thin here and relatively unprotected from any
rays or anything which space might care to hurl in his direction.
He had parked the starship Heart of Gold amongst the huge
jostling dim hulks that crowded the sky here above Krikkit, and
had entered what appeared to be the biggest and most important of
the sky buildings, armed with nothing but a Zap gun and something
for his headaches.
He had found himself in a long, wide and badly lit corridor in
which he was able to hide until he worked out what he was going
to do next. He hid because every now and then one of the Krikkit
robots would walk along it, and although he had so far led some
kind of charmed life at their hands, it had nevertheless been an
extremely painful one, and he had no desire to stretch what he
was only half-inclined to call his good fortune.
He had ducked, at one point, into a room leading off the
corridor, and had discovered it to be a huge and, again, dimly
lit chamber.
In fact, it was a museum with just one exhibit - the wreckage of
a spacecraft. It was terribly burnt and mangled, and, now that he
had caught up with some of the Galactic history he had missed
through his failed attempts to have sex with the girl in the
cybercubicle next to him at school, he was able to put in an
intelligent guess that this was the wrecked spaceship which had
drifted through the Dust Cloud all those billions of years ago
and started the whole business off.
But, and this is where he had become confused, there was
something not at all right about it.
It was genuinely wrecked. It was genuinely burnt, but a fairly
brief inspection by an experienced eye revealed that it was not a
genuine spacecraft. It was as if it was a full-scale model of one
- a solid blueprint. In other words it was a very useful thing to
have around if you suddenly decided to build a spaceship yourself
and didn't know how to do it. It was not, however, anything that
would ever fly anywhere itself.
He was still puzzling over this - in fact he'd only just started
to puzzle over it - when he became aware that a door had slid
open in another part of the chamber, and another couple of
Krikkit robots had entered, looking a little glum.
Zaphod did not want to tangle with them and, deciding that just
as discretion was the better part of valour so was cowardice the
better part of discretion, he valiantly hid himself in a
cupboard.
The cupboard in fact turned out to be the top part of a shaft
which led down through an inspection hatch into a wide
ventilation tunnel. He led himself down into it and started to
crawl along it, which is where we found him.
He didn't like it. It was cold, dark and profoundly
uncomfortable, and it frightened him. At the first opportunity -
which was another shaft a hundred yards further along - he
climbed back up out of it.
This time he emerged into a smaller chamber, which appeared to be
a computer intelligence centre. He emerged in a dark narrow space
between a large computer bank and the wall.
He quickly learned that he was not alone in the chamber and
started to leave again, when he began to listen with interest to
what the other occupants were saying.
"It's the robots, sir," said one voice. "There's something wrong
with them."
"What, exactly?"
These were the voices of two War Command Krikkiters. All the War
Commanders lived up in the sky in the Robot War Zones, and were
largely immune to the whimsical doubts and uncertainties which
were afflicting their fellows down on the surface of the planet.
"Well, sir I think it's just as well that they are being phased
out of the war effort, and that we are now going to detonate the
supernova bomb. In the very short time since we were released
from the envelope -"
"Get to the point."
"The robots aren't enjoying it, sir."
"What?"
"The war, sir, it seems to be getting them down. There's a
certain world-weariness about them, or perhaps I should say
Universe-weariness."
"Well, that's all right, they're meant to be helping to destroy
it."
"Yes, well they're finding it difficult, sir. They are afflicted
with a certain lassitude. They're just finding it hard to get
behind the job. They lack oomph."
"What are you trying to say?"
"Well, I think they're very depressed about something, sir."
"What on Krikkit are you talking about?"
"Well, in the few skirmishes they've had recently, it seems that
they go into battle, raise their weapons to fire and suddenly
think, why bother? What, cosmically speaking, is it all about?
And they just seem to get a little tired and a little grim."
"And then what do they do?"
"Er, quadratic equations mostly, sir. Fiendishly difficult ones
by all accounts. And then they sulk."
"Sulk?"
"Yes, sir."
"Whoever heard of a robot sulking?"
"I don't know, sir."
"What was that noise?"
It was the noise of Zaphod leaving with his head spinning.
In a deep well of darkness a crippled robot sat. It had been
silent in its metallic darkness for some time. It was cold and
damp, but being a robot it was supposed not to be able to notice
these things. With an enormous effort of will, however, it did
manage to notice them.
Its brain had been harnessed to the central intelligence core of
the Krikkit War Computer. It wasn't enjoying the experience, and
neither was the central intelligence core of the Krikkit War
Computer.
The Krikkit robots which had salvaged this pathetic metal
creature from the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta had recognized
almost immediately its gigantic intelligence, and the use which
this could be to them.
They hadn't reckoned with the attendant personality disorders,
which the coldness, the darkness, the dampness, the crampedness
and the loneliness were doing nothing to decrease.
It was not happy with its task.
Apart from anything else, the mere coordination of an entire
planet's military strategy was taking up only a tiny part of its
formidable mind, and the rest of it had become extremely bored.
Having solved all the major mathematical, physical, chemical,
biological, sociological, philosophical, etymological,
meteorological and psychological problems of the Universe except
his own, three times over, he was severely stuck for something to
do, and had taken up composing short dolorous ditties of no tone,
or indeed tune. The latest one was a lullaby.
"Now the world has gone to bed," Marvin droned,
"Darkness won't engulf my head,
"I can see by infra-red,
"How I hate the night."
He paused to gather the artistic and emotional strength to tackle
the next verse.
"Now I lay me down to sleep,
"Try to count electric sheep,
"Sweet dream wishes you can keep,
"How I hate the night."
"Marvin!" hissed a voice.
His head snapped up, almost dislodging the intricate network of
electrodes which connected him to the central Krikkit War
Computer.
An inspection hatch had opened and one of a pair of unruly heads
was peering through whilst the other kept on jogging it by
continually darting to look this way and that extremely
nervously.
"Oh, it's you," muttered the robot. "I might have known."
"Hey, kid," said Zaphod in astonishment, "was that you singing
just then?"
"I am," Marvin acknowledged bitterly, "in particularly
scintillating form at the moment."
Zaphod poked his head in through the hatchway and looked around.
"Are you alone?" he said.
"Yes," said Marvin. "Wearily I sit here, pain and misery my only
companions. And vast intelligence of course. And infinite sorrow.
And ..."
"Yeah," said Zaphod. "Hey, what's your connection with all this?"
"This," said Marvin, indicating with his less damaged arm all the
electrodes which connected him with the Krikkit computer.
"Then," said Zaphod awkwardly, "I guess you must have saved my
life. Twice."
"Three times," said Marvin.
Zaphod's head snapped round (his other one was looking hawkishly
in entirely the wrong direction) just in time to see the lethal
killer robot directly behind him seize up and start to smoke. It
staggered backwards and slumped against a wall. It slid down it.
It slipped sideways, threw its head back and started to sob
inconsolably.
Zaphod looked back at Marvin.
"You must have a terrific outlook on life," he said.
"Just don't even ask," said Marvin.
"I won't," said Zaphod, and didn't. "Hey look," he added, "you're
doing a terrific job."
"Which means, I suppose," said Marvin, requiring only one ten
thousand million billion trillion grillionth part of his mental
powers to make this particular logical leap, "that you're not
going to release me or anything like that."
"Kid, you know I'd love to."
"But you're not going to."
"No."
"I see."
"You're working well."
"Yes," said Marvin. "Why stop now just when I'm hating it?"
"I got to find Trillian and the guys. Hey, you any idea where
they are? I mean, I just got a planet to choose from. Could take
a while."
"They are very close," said Marvin dolefully. "You can monitor
them from here if you like."
"I better go get them," asserted Zaphod. "Er, maybe they need
some help, right?"
"Maybe," said Marvin with unexpected authority in his lugubrious
voice, "it would be better if you monitored them from here. That
young girl," he added unexpectedly, "is one of the least
benightedly unintelligent life forms it has been my profound lack
of pleasure not to be able to avoid meeting."
Zaphod took a moment or two to find his way through this
labyrinthine string of negatives and emerged at the other end
with surprise.
"Trillian?" he said. "She's just a kid. Cute, yeah, but
temperamental. You know how it is with women. Or perhaps you
don't. I assume you don't. If you do I don't want to hear about
it. Plug us in."
"... totally manipulated."
"What?" said Zaphod.
It was Trillian speaking. He turned round.
The wall against which the Krikkit robot was sobbing had lit up
to reveal a scene taking place in some other unknown part of the
Krikkit Robot War zones. It seemed to be a council chamber of
some kind - Zaphod couldn't make it out too clearly because of
the robot slumped against the screen.
He tried to move the robot, but it was heavy with its grief and
tried to bite him, so he just looked around as best he could.
"Just think about it," said Trillian's voice, "your history is
just a series of freakishly improbable events. And I know an
improbable event when I see one. Your complete isolation from the
Galaxy was freakish for a start. Right out on the very edge with
a Dust Cloud around you. It's a set-up. Obviously."
Zaphod was mad with frustration because he couldn't see the
screen. The robot's head was obscuring his view of the people
Trillian as talking to, his multi-functional battleclub was
obscuring the background, and the elbow of the arm it had pressed
tragically against its brow was obscuring Trillian herself.
"Then," said Trillian, "this spaceship that crash-landed on your
planet. That's really likely, isn't it? Have you any idea of what
the odds are against a drifting spaceship accidentally
intersecting with the orbit of a planet?"
"Hey," said Zaphod, "she doesn't know what the zark she's talking
about. I've seen that spaceship. It's a fake. No deal."
"I thought it might be," said Marvin from his prison behind
Zaphod.
"Oh yeah," said Zaphod. "It's easy for you to say that. I just
told you. Anyway, I don't see what it's got to do with anything."
"And especially," continued Trillian, "the odds against it
intersecting with the orbit of the one planet in the Galaxy, or
the whole of the Universe as far as I know, that would be totally
traumatized to see it. You don't know what the odds are? Nor do
I, they're that big. Again, it's a set-up. I wouldn't be
surprised if that spaceship was just a fake."
Zaphod managed to move the robot's battleclub. Behind it on the
screen were the figures of Ford, Arthur and Slartibartfast who
appeared astonished and bewildered by the whole thing.
"Hey, look," said Zaphod excitedly. "The guys are doing great. Ra
ra ra! Go get 'em, guys."
"And what about," said Trillian, "all this technology you
suddenly managed to build for yourselves almost overnight? Most
people would take thousands of years to do all that. Someone was
feeding you what you needed to know, someone was keeping you at
it.
"I know, I know," she added in response to an unseen
interruption, "I know you didn't realize it was going on. This is
exactly my point. You never realized anything at all. Like this
Supernova Bomb."
"How do you know about that?" said an unseen voice.
"I just know," said Trillian. "You expect me to believe that you
are bright enough to invent something that brilliant and be too
dumb to realize it would take you with it as well? That's not
just stupid, that is spectacularly obtuse."
"Hey, what's this bomb thing?" said Zaphod in alarm to Marvin.
"The supernova bomb?" said Marvin. "It's a very, very small
bomb."
"Yeah?"
"That would destroy the Universe in toto," added Marvin. "Good
idea, if you ask me. They won't get it to work, though."
"Why not, if it's so brilliant?"
"It's brilliant," said Marvin, "they're not. They got as far as
designing it before they were locked in the envelope. They've
spent the last five years building it. They think they've got it
right but they haven't. They're as stupid as any other organic
life form. I hate them."
Trillian was continuing.
Zaphod tried to pull the Krikkit robot away by its leg, but it
kicked and growled at him, and then quaked with a fresh outburst
of sobbing. Then suddenly it slumped over and continued to
express its feelings out of everybody's way on the floor.
Trillian was standing alone in the middle of the chamber tired
out but with fiercely burning eyes.
Ranged in front of her were the pale-faced and wrinkled Elder
Masters of Krikkit, motionless behind their widely curved control
desk, staring at her with helpless fear and hatred.
In front of them, equidistant between their control desk and the
middle of the chamber, where Trillian stood, as if on trial, was
a slim white pillar about four feet tall. On top of it stood a
small white globe, about three, maybe four inches in diameter.
Beside it stood a Krikkit robot with its multi-functional
battleclub.
"In fact," explained Trillian, "you are so dumb stupid" (She was
sweating. Zaphod felt that this was an unattractive thing for her
to be doing at this point) "you are all so dumb stupid that I
doubt, I very much doubt, that you've been able to build the bomb
properly without any help from Hactar for the last five years."
"Who's this guy Hactar?" said Zaphod, squaring his shoulders.
If Marvin replied, Zaphod didn't hear him. All his attention was
concentrated on the screen.
One of the Elders of Krikkit made a small motion with his hand
towards the Krikkit robot. The robot raised his club.
"There's nothing I can do," said Marvin. "It's on an independent
circuit from the others."
"Wait," said Trillian.
The Elder made a small motion. The robot halted. Trillian
suddenly seemed very doubtful of her own judgment.
"How do you know all this?" said Zaphod to Marvin at this point.
"Computer records," said Marvin. "I have access."
"You're very different, aren't you," said Trillian to the Elder
Masters, "from your fellow worldlings down on the ground. You've
spent all your lives up here, unprotected by the atmosphere.
You've been very vulnerable. The rest of your race is very
frightened, you know, they don't want you to do this. You're out
of touch, why don't you check up?"
The Krikkit Elder grew impatient. He made a gesture to the robot
which was precisely the opposite of the gesture he had last made
to it.
The robot swung its battleclub. It hit the small white globe.
The small white globe was the supernova bomb.
It was a very, very small bomb which was designed to bring the
entire Universe to an end.
The supernova bomb flew through the air. It hit the back wall of
the council chamber and dented it very badly.
"So how does she know all this?" said Zaphod.
Marvin kept a sullen silence.
"Probably just bluffing," said Zaphod. "Poor kid, I should never
have left her alone."
"Hactar!" called Trillian. "What are you up to?"
There was no reply from the enclosing darkness. Trillian waited,
nervously. She was sure that she couldn't be wrong. She peered
into the gloom from which she had been expecting some kind of
response. But there was only cold silence.
"Hactar?" she called again. "I would like you to meet my friend
Arthur Dent. I wanted to go off with a Thunder God, but he
wouldn't let me and I appreciate that. He made me realize where
my affections really lay. Unfortunately Zaphod is too frightened
by all this, so I brought Arthur instead. I'm not sure why I'm
telling you all this.
"Hello?" she said again. "Hactar?"
And then it came.
It was thin and feeble, like a voice carried on the wind from a
great distance, half heard, a memory of a dream of a voice.
"Won't you both come out," said the voice. "I promise that you
will be perfectly safe."
They glanced at each other, and then stepped out, improbably,
along the shaft of light which streamed out of the open hatchway
of the Heart of Gold into the dim granular darkness of the Dust
Cloud.
Arthur tried to hold her hand to steady and reassure her, but she
wouldn't let him. He held on to his airline hold-all with its tin
of Greek olive oil, its towel, its crumpled postcards of
Santorini and its other odds and ends. He steadied and reassured
that instead.
They were standing on, and in, nothing.
Murky, dusty nothing. Each grain of dust of the pulverized
computer sparkled dimly as it turned and twisted slowly, catching
the sunlight in the darkness. Each particle of the computer, each
speck of dust, held within itself, faintly and weakly, the
pattern of the whole. In reducing the computer to dust the
Silastic Armorfiends of Striterax had merely crippled the
computer, not killed it. A weak and insubstantial field held the
particles in slight relationships with each other.
Arthur and Trillian stood, or rather floated, in the middle of
this bizarre entity. They had nothing to breathe, but for the
moment this seemed not to matter. Hactar kept his promise. They
were safe. For the moment.
"I have nothing to offer you by way of hospitality," said Hactar
faintly, "but tricks of the light. It is possible to be
comfortable with tricks of the light, though, if that is all you
have."
His voice evanesced, and in the dark dust a long velvet paisley-
covered sofa coalesced into hazy shape.
Arthur could hardly bear the fact that it was the same sofa which
had appeared to him in the fields of prehistoric Earth. He wanted
to shout and shake with rage that the Universe kept doing these
insanely bewildering things to him.
He let this feeling subside, and then sat on the sofa -
carefully. Trillian sat on it too.
It was real.
At least, if it wasn't real, it did support them, and as that is
what sofas are supposed to do, this, by any test that mattered,
was a real sofa.
The voice on the solar wind breathed to them again.
"I hope you are comfortable," it said.
They nodded.
"And I would like to congratulate you on the accuracy of your
deductions."
Arthur quickly pointed out that he hadn't deduced anything much
himself, Trillian was the one. She had simply asked him along
because he was interested in life, the Universe, and everything.
"That is something in which I too am interested," breathed
Hactar.
"Well," said Arthur, "we should have a chat about it sometime.
Over a cup of tea."
There slowly materialized in front of them a small wooden table
on which sat a silver teapot, a bone china milk jug, a bone china
sugar bowl, and two bone china cups and saucers.
Arthur reached forward, but they were just a trick of the light.
He leaned back on the sofa, which was an illusion his body was
prepared to accept as comfortable.
"Why," said Trillian, "do you feel you have to destroy the
Universe?"
She found it a little difficult talking into nothingness, with
nothing on which to focus. Hactar obviously noticed this. He
chuckled a ghostly chuckle.
"If it's going to be that sort of session," he said, "we may as
well have the right sort of setting."
And now there materialized in front of them something new. It was
the dim hazy image of a couch - a psychiatrist's couch. The
leather with which it was upholstered was shiny and sumptuous,
but again, it was only a trick of the light.
Around them, to complete the setting, was the hazy suggestion of
wood-panelled walls. And then, on the couch, appeared the image
of Hactar himself, and it was an eye-twisting image.
The couch looked normal size for a psychiatrist's couch - about
five or six feet long.
The computer looked normal size for a black space-borne computer
satellite - about a thousand miles across.
The illusion that the one was sitting on top of the other was the
thing which made the eyes twist.
"All right," said Trillian firmly. She stood up off the sofa. She
felt that she was being asked to feel too comfortable and to
accept too many illusions.
"Very good," she said. "Can you construct real things too? I mean
solid objects?"
Again there was a pause before the answer, as if the pulverized
mind of Hactar had to collect its thoughts from the millions and
millions of miles over which it was scattered.
"Ah," he sighed. "You are thinking of the spaceship."
Thoughts seemed to drift by them and through them, like waves
through the ether.
"Yes," he acknowledge, "I can.
"But it takes enormous effort and time. All I can do in my ...
particle state, you see, is encourage and suggest. Encourage and
suggest. And suggest ..."
The image of Hactar on the couch seemed to billow and waver, as
if finding it hard to maintain itself.
It gathered new strength.
"I can encourage and suggest," it said, "tiny pieces of space
debris - the odd minute meteor, a few molecules here, a few
hydrogen atoms there - to move together. I encourage them
together. I can tease them into shape, but it takes many aeons."
"So, did you make," asked Trillian again, "the model of the
wrecked spacecraft?"
"Er ... yes," murmured Hactar. "I have made ... a few things. I
can move them about. I made the spacecraft. It seemed best to
do."
Something then made Arthur pick up his hold-all from where he had
left it on the sofa and grasp it tightly.
The mist of Hactar's ancient shattered mind swirled about them as
if uneasy dreams were moving through it.
"I repented, you see," he murmured dolefully. "I repented of
sabotaging my own design for the Silastic Armorfiends. It was not
my place to make such decisions. I was created to fulfill a
function and I failed in it. I negated my own existence."
Hactar sighed, and they waited in silence for him to continue his
story.
"You were right," he said at length. "I deliberately nurtured the
planet of Krikkit till they would arrive at the same state of
mind as the Silastic Armorfiends, and require of me the design of
the bomb I failed to make the first time. I wrapped myself around
the planet and coddled it. Under the influence of events I was
able to generate, they learned to hate like maniacs. I had to
make them live in the sky. On the ground my influences were too
weak.
"Without me, of course, when they were locked away from me in the
envelope of Slo-Time, their responses became very confused and
they were unable to manage.
"Ah well, ah well," he added, "I was only trying to fulfill my
function."
And very gradually, very, very slowly, the images in the cloud
began to fade, gently to melt away.
And then, suddenly, they stopped fading.
"There was also the matter of revenge, of course," said Hactar,
with a sharpness which was new in his voice.
"Remember," he said, "that I was pulverized, and then left in a
crippled and semi-impotent state for billions of years. I
honestly would rather wipe out the Universe. You would feel the
same way, believe me."
He paused again, as eddies swept through the Dust.
"But primarily," he said in his former, wistful tone, "I was
trying to fulfill my function. Ah well."
Trillian said, "Does it worry you that you have failed?"
"Have I failed?" whispered Hactar. The image of the computer on
the psychiatrist's couch began slowly to fade again.
"Ah well, ah well," the fading voice intoned again. "No, failure
doesn't bother me now."
"You know what we have to do?" said Trillian, her voice cold and
businesslike.
"Yes," said Hactar, "you're going to disperse me. You are going
to destroy my consciousness. Please be my guest - after all these
aeons, oblivion is all I crave. If I haven't already fulfilled my
function, then it's too late now. Thank you and good night."
The sofa vanished.
The tea table vanished.
The couch and the computer vanished. the walls were gone. Arthur
and Trillian made their curious way back into the Heart of Gold.
"Well, that," said Arthur, "would appear to be that."
The flames danced higher in front of him and then subsided. A few
last licks and they were gone, leaving him with just a pile of
Ashes, where a few minutes previously there had been the Wooden
Pillar of Nature and Spirituality.
He scooped them off the hob of the Heart of Gold's Gamma
barbecue, put them in a paper bag, and walked back into the
bridge.
"I think we should take them back," he said. "I feel that very
strongly."
He had already had an argument with Slartibartfast on this
matter, and eventually the old man had got annoyed and left. he
had returned to his own ship the Bistromath, had a furious row
with the waiter and disappeared off into an entirely subjective
idea of what space was.
The argument had arisen because Arthur's idea of returning the
Ashes to Lord's Cricket Ground at the same moment that they were
originally taken would involve travelling back in time a day or
so, and this was precisely the sort of gratuitous and
irresponsible mucking about that the Campaign for Real Time was
trying to put a stop to.
"Yes," Arthur had said, "but you try and explain that to the
MCC," and he would hear no more against the idea.
"I think," he said again, and stopped. The reason he started to
say it again was because no one had listened to him the first
time, and the reason he stopped was because it looked fairly
clear that no one was going to listen to him this time either.
Ford, Zaphod and Trillian were watching the visiscreens intently
as Hactar was dispersing under pressure from a vibration field
which the Heart of Gold was pumping into it.
"What did it say?" asked Ford.
"I thought I heard it say," said Trillian in a puzzle voice,
"What's done is done ... I have fulfilled my function ...'"
"I think we should take these back," said Arthur holding up the
bag containing the Ashes. "I feel that very strongly."
The sun was shining calmly on a scene of complete havoc.
Smoke was still billowing across the burnt grass in the wake of
the theft of the Ashes by the Krikkit robots. Through the smoke,
people were running panicstricken, colliding with each other,
tripping over stretchers, being arrested.
One policeman was attempting to arrest Wowbagger the Infinitely
Prolonged for insulting behaviour, but was unable to prevent the
tall grey-green alien from returning to his ship and arrogantly
flying away, thus causing even more panic and pandemonium.
In the middle of this, for the second time that afternoon, the
figures of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect suddenly materialized,
they had teleported down out of the Heart of Gold which was now
in parking orbit round the planet.
"I can explain," shouted Arthur. "I have the Ashes! They're in
this bag."
"I don't think you have their attention," said Ford.
"I have also helped save the Universe," called Arthur to anyone
who was prepared to listen, in other words no one.
"That should have been a crowd-stopper," said Arthur to Ford.
"It wasn't," said Ford.
Arthur accosted a policeman who was running past.
"Excuse me," he said. "The Ashes. I've got them. They were stolen
by those white robots a moment ago. I've got them in this bag.
They were part of the Key to the Slo-Time envelope, you see, and,
well, anyway you can guess the rest, the point is I've got them
and what should I do with them?"
The policeman told him, but Arthur could only assume that he was
speaking metaphorically.
He wandered about disconsolately.
"Is no one interested?" he shouted out. A man rushed past him and
jogged his elbow, he dropped the paper bag and it spilt its
contents all over the ground. Arthur stared down at it with a
tight-set mouth.
Ford looked at him.
"Wanna go now?" he said.
Arthur heaved a heavy sigh. He looked around at the planet Earth,
for what he was now certain would be the last time.
"OK," he said.
At that moment, through the clearing smoke, he caught sight of
one of the wickets, still standing in spite of everything.
"Hold on a moment," he said to Ford. "When I was a boy ..."
"Can you tell me later?"
"I had a passion for cricket, you know, but I wasn't very good at
it."
"Or not at all, if you prefer."
"And I always dreamed, rather stupidly, that one day I would bowl
at Lord's."
He looked around him at the panicstricken throng. No one was
going to mind very much.
"OK," said Ford wearily. "Get it over with. I shall be over
there," he added, "being bored." He went and sat down on a patch
of smoking grass.
Arthur remembered that on their first visit there that afternoon,
the cricket ball had actually landed in his bag, and he looked
through the bag.
He had already found the ball in it before he remembered that it
wasn't the same bag that he'd had at the time. Still, there the
ball was amongst his souvenirs of Greece.
He took it out and polished it against his hip, spat on it and
polished it again. He put the bag down. He was going to do this
properly.
He tossed the small hard red ball from hand to hand, feeling its
weight.
With a wonderful feeling of lightness and unconcern, he trotted
off away from the wicket. A medium-fast pace, he decided, and
measured a good long run-up.
He looked up into the sky. The birds were wheeling about it, a
few white clouds scudded across it. The air was disturbed with
the sounds of police and ambulance sirens, and people screaming
and yelling, but he felt curiously happy and untouched by it all.
He was going to bowl a ball at Lord's.
He turned and pawed a couple of times at the ground with his
bedroom slippers. He squared his shoulders, tossed the ball in
the air and caught it again.
He started to run.
As he ran, he saw that standing at the wicket was a batsman.
Oh, good, he thought, that should add a little ...
Then, as his running feet took him nearer, he saw more clearly.
The batsman standing ready at the wicket was not one of the
England cricket team. He was not one of the Australian cricket
team. It was one of the robot Krikkit team. It was a cold, hard,
lethal white killer-robot that presumably had not returned to its
ship with the others.
Quite a few thoughts collided in Arthur Dent's mind at tis
moment, but he didn't seem to be able to stop running. Time
seemed to be going terribly, terribly slowly, but still he didn't
seem to be able to stop running.
Moving as if through syrup, he slowly turned his troubled head
and looked at his own hand, the hand which was holding the small
hard red ball.
His feet were pounding slowly onwards, unstoppably, as he stared
at the ball gripped in his helpless hand. It was emitting a deep
red glow and flashing intermittently. And still his feet were
pounding inexorably forward.
He looked at the Krikkit robot again standing implacably still
and purposefully in front of him, battleclub raised in readiness.
Its eyes were burning with a deep cold fascinating light, and
Arthur could not move his own eyes from them. He seemed to be
looking down a tunnel at them - nothing on either side seemed to
exist.
Some of the thoughts which were colliding in his mind at this
time were these:
He felt a hell of a fool.
He felt that he should have listened rather more carefully to a
number of things he had heard said, phrases which now pounded
round in his mind as his feet pounded onwards to the point where
he would inevitably release the ball to the Krikkit robot, who
would inevitably strike it.
He remembered Hactar saying, "Have I failed? Failure doesn't
bother me."
He remembered the account of Hactar's dying words, "What's done
is done, I have fulfilled my function."
He remembered Hactar saying that he had managed to make "a few
things."
He remembered the sudden movement in his hold-all that had made
him grip it tightly to himself when he was in the Dust Cloud.
He remembered that he had travelled back in time a couple of days
to come to Lord's again.
He also remembered that he wasn't a very good bowler.
He felt his arm coming round, gripping tightly on to the ball
which he now knew for certain was the supernova bomb that Hactar
had built himself and planted on him, the bomb which would cause
the Universe to come to an abrupt and premature end.
He hoped and prayed that there wasn't an afterlife. Then he
realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped
that there wasn't an afterlife.
He would feel very, very embarrassed meeting everybody.
He hoped, he hoped, he hoped that his bowling was as bad as he
remembered it to be, because that seemed to be the only thing now
standing between this moment and universal oblivion.
He felt his legs pounding, he felt his arm coming round, he felt
his feet connecting with the airline hold-all he'd stupidly left
lying on the ground in front of him, he felt himself falling
heavily forward but, having his mind so terribly full of other
things at this moment, he completely forgot about hitting the
ground and didn't.
Still holding the ball firmly in his right hand he soared up into
the air whimpering with surprise.
He wheeled and whirled through the air, spinning out of control.
He twisted down towards the ground, flinging himself hectically
through the air, at the same time hurling the bomb harmlessly off
into the distance.
He hurtled towards the astounded robot from behind. It still had
its multi-functional battleclub raised, but had suddenly been
deprived of anything to hit.
With a sudden mad access of strength, he wrestled the battleclub
from the grip of the startled robot, executed a dazzling banking
turn in the air, hurtled back down in a furious power-drive and
with one crazy swing knocked the robot's head from the robot's
shoulders.
"Are you coming now?" said Ford.
Life, the Universe and Everything
And at the end they travelled again.
There was a time when Arthur Dent would not. He said that the
Bistromathic Drive had revealed to him that time and distance
were one, that mind and Universe were one, that perception and
reality were one, and that the more one travelled the more one
stayed in one place, and that what with one thing and another he
would rather just stay put for a while and sort it all out in his
mind, which was now at one with the Universe so it shouldn't take
too long, and he could get a good rest afterwards, put in a
little flying practice and learn to cook which he had always
meant to do. The can of Greek olive oil was now his most prized
possession, and he said that the way it had unexpectedly turned
up in his life had again given him a certain sense of the oneness
of things which made him feel that ...
He yawned and fell asleep.
In the morning as they prepared to take him to some quiet and
idyllic planet where they wouldn't mind him talking like that
they suddenly picked up a computer-driven distress call and
diverted to investigate.
A small but apparently undamaged spacecraft of the Merida class
seemed to be dancing a strange little jig through the void. A
brief computer scan revealed that the ship was fine, its computer
was fine, but that its pilot was mad.
"Half-mad, half-mad," the man insisted as they carried him,
raving, aboard.
He was a journalist with the Siderial Daily Mentioner. They
sedated him and sent Marvin in to keep him company until he
promised to try and talk sense.
"I was covering a trial," he said at last, "on Argabuthon."
He pushed himself up on to his thin wasted shoulders, his eyes
stared wildly. His white hair seemed to be waving at someone it
knew in the next room.
"Easy, easy," said Ford. Trillian put a soothing hand on his
shoulder.
The man sank back down again and stared at the ceiling of the
ship's sick bay.
"The case," he said, "is now immaterial, but there was a witness
... a witness ... a man called ... called Prak. A strange and
difficult man. They were eventually forced to administer a drug
to make him tell the truth, a truth drug."
His eyes rolled helplessly in his head.
"They gave him too much," he said in a tiny whimper. "They gave
him much too much." He started to cry. "I thing the robots must
have jogged the surgeon's arm."
"Robots?" said Zaphod sharply. "What robots?"
"Some white robots," whispered the man hoarsely, "broke into the
courtroom and stole the judge's sceptre, the Argabuthon Sceptre
of Justice, nasty Perspex thing. I don't know why they wanted
it." He began to cry again. "And I think they jogged the
surgeon's arm ..."
He shook his head loosely from side to side, helplessly, sadly,
his eyes screwed up in pain.
"And when the trial continued," he said in a weeping whisper,
"they asked Prak a most unfortunate thing. They asked him," he
paused and shivered, "to tell the Truth, the Whole Truth and
Nothing but the Truth. Only, don't you see?"
He suddenly hoisted himself up on to his elbows again and shouted
at them.
"They'd given him much too much of the drug!"
He collapsed again, moaning quietly. "Much too much too much too
much too ..."
The group gathered round his bedside glanced at each other. there
were goose pimples on backs.
"What happened?" said Zaphod at last.
"Oh, he told it all right," said the man savagely, "for all I
know he's still telling it now. Strange, terrible things ...
terrible, terrible!" he screamed.
They tried to calm him, but he struggled to his elbows again.
"Terrible things, incomprehensible things," he shouted, "things
that would drive a man mad!"
He stared wildly at them.
"Or in my case," he said, "half-mad. I'm a journalist."
"You mean," said Arthur quietly, "that you are used to
confronting the truth?"
"No," said the man with a puzzled frown. "I mean that I made an
excuse and left early."
He collapsed into a coma from which he recovered only once and
briefly.
On that one occasion, they discovered from him the following:
When it became clear that Prak could not be stopped, that here
was truth in its absolute and final form, the court was cleared.
Not only cleared, it was sealed up, with Prak still in it. Steel
walls were erected around it, and, just to be on the safe side,
barbed wire, electric fences, crocodile swamps and three major
armies were installed, so that no one would ever have to hear
Prak speak.
"That's a pity," said Arthur. "I'd like to hear what he had to
say. Presumably he would know what the Ultimate Question to the
Ultimate Answer is. It's always bothered me that we never found
out."
"Think of a number," said the computer, " any number."
Arthur told the computer the telephone number of King's Cross
railway station passenger inquiries, on the grounds that it must
have some function, and this might turn out to be it.
The computer injected the number into the ship's reconstituted
Improbability Drive.
In Relativity, Matter tells Space how to curve, and Space tells
Matter how to move.
The Heart of Gold told space to get knotted, and parked itself
neatly within the inner steel perimeter of the Argabuthon Chamber
of Law.
The courtroom was an austere place, a large dark chamber, clearly
designed for Justice rather than, for instance, for Pleasure. You
wouldn't hold a dinner party here - at least, not a successful
one. The decor would get your guests down.
The ceilings were high, vaulted and very dark. Shadows lurked
there with grim determination. The panelling for the walls and
benches, the cladding of the heavy pillars, all were carved from
the darkest and most severe trees in the fearsome Forest of
Arglebard. The massive black Podium of Justice which dominated
the centre of the chamber was a monster of gravity. If a sunbeam
had ever managed to slink this far into the Justice complex of
Argabuthon it would have turned around and slunk straight back
out again.
Arthur and Trillian were the first in, whilst Ford and Zaphod
bravely kept a watch on their rear.
At first it seemed totally dark and deserted. their footsteps
echoed hollowly round the chamber. This seemed curious. All the
defences were still in position and operative around the outside
of the building, they had run scan checks. Therefore, they had
assumed, the truth-telling must still be going on.
But there was nothing.
Then, as their eyes became accustomed to the darkness, they
spotted a dull red glow in a corner, and behind the glow a live
shadow. They swung a torch round on to it.
Prak was lounging on a bench, smoking a listless cigarette.
"Hi," he said, with a little half-wave. His voice echoed through
the chamber. He was a little man with scraggy hair. He sat with
his shoulders hunched forward and his head and knees kept
jiggling. He took a drag of his cigarette.
They stared at him.
"What's going on?" said Trillian.
"Nothing," said the man and jiggled his shoulders.
Arthur shone his torch full on Prak's face.
"We thought," he said, "that you were meant to be telling the
Truth, the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth."
"Oh, that," said Prak. "Yeah. I was. I finished. There's not
nearly as much of it as people imagine. Some of it's pretty
funny, though."
He suddenly exploded in about three seconds of manical laughter
and stopped again. he sat there, jiggling his head and knees. He
dragged on his cigarette with a strange half-smile.
Ford and Zaphod came forward out of the shadows.
"Tell us about it," said Ford.
"Oh, I can't remember any of it now," said Prak. "I thought of
writing some of it down, but first I couldn't find a pencil, and
then I thought, why bother?"
There was a long silence, during which they thought they could
feel the Universe age a little. Prak stared into the torchlight.
"None of it?" said Arthur at last. "You can remember none of it?"
"No. Except most of the good bits were about frogs, I remember
that."
Suddenly he was hooting with laughter again and stamping his feet
on the ground.
"You would not believe some of the things about frogs," he
gasped. "Come on let's go and find ourselves a frog. Boy, will I
ever see them in a new light!" He leapt to his feet and did a
tiny little dance. Then he stopped and took a long drag at his
cigarette.
"Let's find a frog I can laugh at," he said simply. "Anyway, who
are you guys?"
"We came to find you," said Trillian, deliberately not keeping
the disappointment out of her voice. "My name is Trillian."
Prak jiggled his head.
"Ford Prefect," said Ford Prefect with a shrug.
Prak jiggled his head.
"And I," said Zaphod, when he judged that the silence was once
again deep enough to allow an announcement of such gravity to be
tossed in lightly, "am Zaphod Beeblebrox."
Prak jiggled his head.
"Who's this guy?" said Prak jiggling his shoulder at Arthur, who
was standing silent for a moment, lost in disappointed thoughts.
"Me?" said Arthur. "Oh, my name's Arthur Dent."
Prak's eyes popped out of his head.
"No kidding?" he yelped. "You are Arthur Dent? The Arthur Dent?"
He staggered backwards, clutching his stomach and convulsed with
fresh paroxysms o laughter.
"Hey, just think of meeting you!" he gasped. "Boy," he shouted,
"you are the most ... wow, you just leave the frogs standing!"
he howled and screamed with laughter. He fell over backwards on
to the bench. He hollered and yelled in hysterics. He cried with
laughter, he kicked his legs in the air, he beat his chest.
Gradually he subsided, panting. He looked at them. He looked at
Arthur. He fell back again howling with laughter. Eventually he
fell asleep.
Arthur stood there with his lips twitching whilst the others
carried Prak comatose on to the ship.
"Before we picked up Prak," said Arthur, "I was going to leave. I
still want to, and I think I should do so as soon as possible."
The others nodded in silence, a silence which was only slightly
undermined by the heavily muffled and distant sound of hysterical
laughter which came drifting from Prak's cabin at the farthest
end of the ship.
"We have questioned him," continued Arthur, "or at least, you
have questioned him - I, as you know, can't go near him - on
everything, and he doesn't really seem to have anything to
contribute. Just the occasional snippet, and things I don't want
to hear about frogs."
The others tried not to smirk.
"Now, I am the first to appreciate a joke," said Arthur and then
had to wait for the others to stop laughing.
"I am the first ..." he stopped again. This time he stopped and
listened to the silence. There actually was silence this time,
and it had come very suddenly.
Prak was quiet. For days they had lived with constant manical
laughter ringing round the ship, only occasionally relieved by
short periods of light giggling and sleep. Arthur's very soul was
clenched with paranoia.
This was not the silence of sleep. A buzzer sounded. A glance at
a board told them that the buzzer had been sounded by Prak.
"He's not well," said Trillian quietly. "The constant laughing is
completely wrecking his body."
Arthur's lips twitched but he said nothing.
"We'd better go and see him," said Trillian.
Trillian came out of the cabin wearing her serious face.
"He wants you to go in," she said to Arthur, who was wearing his
glum and tight-lipped one. He thrust his hands deep into his
dressing-gown pockets and tried to think of something to say
which wouldn't sound petty. It seemed terribly unfair, but he
couldn't.
"Please," said Trillian.
He shrugged and went in, taking his glum and tight-lipped face
with him, despite the reaction this always provoked from Prak.
He looked down at his tormentor, who was lying quietly on the
bed, ashen and wasted. His breathing was very shallow. Ford and
Zaphod were standing by the bed looking awkward.
"You wanted to ask me something," said Prak in a thin voice and
coughed slightly.
Just the cough made Arthur stiffen, but it passed and subsided.
"How do you know that?" he asked.
Prak shrugged weakly. "'Cos it's true," he said simply.
Arthur took the point.
"Yes," he said at last in rather a strained drawl. "I did have a
question. Or rather, what I actually have is an Answer. I wanted
to know what the Question was."
Prak nodded sympathetically, and Arthur relaxed a little.
"It's ... well, it's a long story," he said, "but the Question I
would like to know is the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe
and Everything. All we know is that the Answer is Forty-Two,
which is a little aggravating."
Prak nodded again.
"Forty-Two," he said. "Yes, that's right."
He paused. Shadows of thought and memory crossed his face like
the shadows of clouds crossing the land.
"I'm afraid," he said at last, "that the Question and the Answer
are mutually exclusive. Knowledge of one logically precludes
knowledge of the other. It is impossible that both can ever be
known about the same universe."
He paused again. Disappointment crept into Arthur's face and
snuggled down into its accustomed place.
"Except," said Prak, struggling to sort a thought out, "if it
happened, it seems that the Question and the Answer would just
cancel each other out and take the Universe with them, which
would then be replaced by something even more bizarrely
inexplicable. It is possible that this has already happened," he
added with a weak smile, "but there is a certain amount of
Uncertainty about it."
A little giggle brushed through him.
Arthur sat down on a stool.
"Oh well," he said with resignation, "I was just hoping there
would be some sort of reason."
"Do you know," said Prak, "the story of the Reason?"
Arthur said that he didn't, and Prak said that he knew that he
didn't.
He told it.
One night, he said, a spaceship appeared in the sky of a planet
which had never seen one before. The planet was Dalforsas, the
ship was this one. It appeared as a brilliant new star moving
silently across the heavens.
Primitive tribesmen who were sitting huddled on the Cold
Hillsides looked up from their steaming night-drinks and pointed
with trembling fingers, swearing that they had seen a sign, a
sign from their gods which meant that they must now arise at last
and go and slay the evil Princes of the Plains.
In the high turrets of their palaces, the Princes of the Plains
looked up and saw the shining star, and received it unmistakably
as a sign from their gods that they must now go and set about the
accursed Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides.
And between them, the Dwellers in the Forest looked up into the
sky and saw the sigh of the new star, and saw it with fear and
apprehension, for though they had never seen anything like it
before, they too knew precisely what it foreshadowed, and they
bowed their heads in despair.
They knew that when the rains came, it was a sign.
When the rains departed, it was a sign.
When the winds rose, it was a sign.
When the winds fell, it was a sign.
When in the land there was born at midnight of a full moon a goat
with three heads, that was a sign.
When in the land there was born at some time in the afternoon a
perfectly normal cat or pig with no birth complications at all,
or even just a child with a retrousse nose, that too would often
be taken as a sign.
So there was no doubt at all that a new star in the sky was a
sign of a particularly spectacular order.
And each new sign signified the same thing - that the Princes of
the Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides were about to
beat the hell out of each other again.
This in itself wouldn't be so bad, except that the Princes of the
Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides always elected to
beat the hell out of each other in the Forest, and it was always
the Dwellers in the Forest who came off worst in these exchanges,
though as far as they could see it never had anything to do with
them.
And sometimes, after some of the worst of these outrages, the
Dwellers in the Forest would send a messenger to either the
leader of the Princes of the Plains or the leader of the
Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides and demand to know the reason for
this intolerable behaviour.
And the leader, whichever one it was, would take the messenger
aside and explain the Reason to him, slowly and carefully and
with great attention to the considerable detail involved.
And the terrible thing was, it was a very good one. It was very
clear, very rational, and tough. The messenger would hang his
head and feel sad and foolish that he had not realized what a
tough and complex place the real world was, and what difficulties
and paradoxes had to be embraced if one was to live in it.
"Now do you understand?" the leader would say.
The messenger would nod dumbly.
"And you see these battles have to take place?"
Another dumb nod.
"And why they have to take place in the forest, and why it is in
everybody's best interest, the Forest Dwellers included, that
they should?"
"Er ..."
"In the long run."
"Er, yes."
And the messenger did understand the Reason, and he returned to
his people in the Forest. But as he approached them, as he walked
through the Forest and amongst the trees, he found that all he
could remember of the Reason was how terribly clear the argument
had seemed. What it actually was he couldn't remember at all.
And this, of course, was a great comfort when next the Tribesmen
and the Princes came hacking and burning their way through the
Forest, killing every Forest Dweller in their way.
Prak paused in his story and coughed pathetically.
"I was the messenger," he said, "after the battles precipitated
by the appearance of your ship, which were particularly savage.
Many of our people died. I thought I could bring the Reason back.
I went and was told it by the leader of the Princes, but on the
way back it slipped and melted away in my mind like snow in the
sun. That was many years ago, and much has happened since then."
He looked up at Arthur and giggled again very gently.
"There is one other thing I can remember from the truth drug.
Apart from the frogs, and that is God's last message to his
creation. Would you like to hear it?"
For a moment they didn't know whether to take him seriously.
"'Strue," he said. "For real. I mean it."
His chest heaved weakly and he struggled for breath. His head
lolled slightly.
"I wasn't very impressed with it when I first knew what it was,"
he said, "but now I think back to how impressed I was by the
Prince's Reason, and how soon afterwards I couldn't recall it at
all, I think it might be a lot more helpful. Would you like to
know what it is? Would you?"
They nodded dumbly.
"I bet you would. If you're that interested I suggest you go and
look for it. It is written in thirty-foot-high letters of fire on
top of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of
Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the sun
Zarss in Galactic Sector QQ Active J Gamma. It is guarded by the
Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob."
There was a long silence following this announcement, which was
finally broken by Arthur.
"Sorry, it's where?" he said.
"It is written," repeated Prak, "in thirty-foot-high letters of
fire on top of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of
Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the ..."
"Sorry," said Arthur again, "which mountains?"
"The Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of Sevorbeupstry on
the planet ..."
"Which land was that? I didn't quite catch it."
"Sevorbeupstry, on the planet ..."
"Sevorbe-what?"
"Oh, for heaven's sake," said Prak and died testily.
In the following days Arthur thought a little about this message,
but in the end he decided that he was not going to allow himself
to be drawn by it, and insisted on following his original plan of
finding a nice little world somewhere to settle down and lead a
quiet retired life. Having saved the Universe twice in one day he
thought that he could take things a little easier from now on.
They dropped him off on the planet Krikkit, which was now once
again an idyllic pastoral world, even if the songs did
occasionally get on his nerves.
He spent a lot of time flying.
He learnt to communicate with birds and discovered that their
conversation was fantastically boring. It was all to do with wind
speed, wing spans, power-to-weight ratios and a fair bit about
berries. Unfortunately, he discovered, once you have learnt
birdspeak you quickly come to realize that the air is full of it
the whole time, just inane bird chatter. There is no getting away
from it.
For that reason Arthur eventually gave up the sport and learnt to
live on the ground and love it, despite a lot of the inane
chatter he heard down there as well.
One day, he was walking through the fields humming a ravishing
tune he'd heard recently when a silver spaceship descended from
the sky and landed in front of him.
A hatchway opened, a ramp extended, and a tall grey-green alien
marched out and approached him.
"Arthur Phili ..." it said, then glanced sharply at him and down
at his clipboard. He frowned. He looked up at him again.
"I've done you before haven't I?" he said.
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of
the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded
yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles
is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-
descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still
think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most
of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.
Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these
were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces
of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small
green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and
most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big
mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And
some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no
one should ever have left the oceans.
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man
had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be
nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a
small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that
had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the
world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was
right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to
anything.
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone
about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea
was lost forever.
This is her story.
That evening it was dark early, which was normal for the time of
year. It was cold and windy, which was normal.
It started to rain, which was particularly normal.
A spacecraft landed, which was not.
There was nobody around to see it except some spectacularly
stupid quadrupeds who hadn't the faintest idea what to make of
it, or whether they were meant to make anything of it, or eat it,
or what. So they did what they did to everything which was to run
away from it and try to hide under each other, which never
worked.
It slipped down out of the clouds, seemingly balanced on a single
beam of light.
From a distance you would scarcely have noticed it through the
lightning and the storm clouds, but seen from close to it was
strangely beautiful - a grey craft of elegantly sculpted form:
quite small.
Of course, one never has the slightest notion what size or shape
different species are going to turn out to be, but if you were to
take the findings of the latest Mid-Galactic Census report as any
kind of accurate guide to statistical averages you would probably
guess that the craft would hold about six people, and you would
be right.
You'd probably guessed that anyway. The Census report, like most
such surveys, had cost an awful lot of money and didn't tell
anybody anything they didn't already know - except that every
single person in the Galaxy had . legs and owned a hyena. Since
this was clearly not true the whole thing had eventually to be
scrapped.
The craft slid quietly down through the rain, its dim operating
lights wrapping it in tasteful rainbows. It hummed very quietly,
a hum which became gradually louder and deeper as it approached
the ground, and which at an altitude of six inches became a heavy
throb.
At last it dropped and was quiet.
A hatchway opened. A short flight of steps unfolded itself.
A light appeared in the opening, a bright light streaming out
into the wet night, and shadows moved within.
A tall figure appeared in the light, looked around, flinched, and
hurried down the steps, carrying a large shopping bag under its
arm.
It turned and gave a single abrupt wave back at the ship. Already
the rain was streaming through its hair.
"Thank you," he called out, "thank you very ..."
He was interrupted by a sharp crack of thunder. He glanced up
apprehensively, and in response to a sudden thought quickly
started to rummage through the large plastic shopping bag, which
he now discovered had a hole in the bottom.
It had large characters printed on the side which read (to anyone
who could decipher the Centaurian alphabet) Duty free Mega-
Market, Port Brasta, Alpha Centauri. Be Like the Twenty-Second
Elephant with Heated Value in Space - Bark!
"Hold on!" the figure called, waving at the ship.
The steps, which had started to fold themselves back through the
hatchway, stopped, re-unfolded, and allowed him back in.
He emerged again a few seconds later carrying a battered and
threadbare towel which he shoved into the bag.
He waved again, hoisted the bag under his arm, and started to run
for the shelter of some trees as, behind him, the spacecraft had
already begun its ascent.
Lightning flitted through the sky and made the figure pause for a
moment, and then hurry onwards, revising his path to give the
trees a wide berth. He moved swiftly across the ground, slipping
here and there, hunching himself against the rain which was
falling now with ever-increasing concentration, as if being
pulled from the sky.
His feet sloshed through the mud. Thunder grumbled over the
hills. He pointlessly wiped the rain off his face and stumbled
on.
More lights.
Not lightning this time, but more diffused and dimmer lights
which played slowly over the horizon and faded.
The figure paused again on seeing them, and then redoubled his
steps, making directly towards the point on the horizon at which
they had appeared.
And now the ground was becoming steeper, sloping upwards, and
after another two or three hundred yards it led at last to an
obstacle. The figure paused to examine the barrier and then
dropped the bag he was carrying over it before climbing over
himself.
Hardly had the figure touched the ground on the other side when
there came sweeping out of the rain towards him a machine, lights
streaming through the wall of water. The figure pressed back as
the machine streaked towards him. it was a low bulbous shape,
like a small whale surfing - sleek, grey and rounded and moving
at terrifying speed.
The figure instinctively threw up his hands to protect himself,
but was hit only by a sluice of water as the machine swept past
and off into the night.
It was illuminated briefly by another flicker of lightning
crossing the sky, which allowed the soaked figure by the roadside
a split-second to read a small sign at the back of the machine
before it disappeared.
To the figure's apparent incredulous astonishment the sign read,
"My other car is also a Porsche."
Rob McKeena was a miserable bastard and he knew it because he'd
had a lot of people point it out to him over the years and he saw
no reason to disagree with them except the obvious one which was
that he liked disagreeing with people, particularly people he
disliked, which included, at the last count, everyone.
He heaved a sigh and shoved down a gear.
The hill was beginning to steepen and his lorry was heavy with
Danish thermostatic radiator controls.
It wasn't that he was naturally predisposed to be so surly, at
least he hoped not. It was just the rain which got him down,
always the rain.
It was raining now, just for a change.
It was a particular type of rain he particularly disliked,
particularly when he was driving. He had a number for it. It was
rain type .
He had read somewhere that the Eskimos had over two hundred
different words for snow, without which their conversation would
probably have got very monotonous. So they would distinguish
between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and heavy snow,
sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow that
came in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your
neighbour's boots all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows
of winter, the snows of spring, the snows you remember from your
childhood that were so much better than any of your modern snow,
fine snow, feathery snow, hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls
in the morning, snow that falls at night, snow that falls all of
a sudden just when you were going out fishing, and snow that
despite all your efforts to train them, the huskies have pissed
on.
Rob McKeena had two hundred and thirty-one different types of
rain entered in his little book, and he didn't like any of them.
He shifted down another gear and the lorry heaved its revs up. It
grumbled in a comfortable sort of way about all the Danish
thermostatic radiator controls it was carrying.
Since he had left Denmark the previous afternoon, he had been
through types (light pricking drizzle which made the roads
slippery), ( heavy spotting), to (vertical light drizzle
through to sharply slanting light to moderate drizzle
freshening), and (two finely distinguished varieties of
vertical torrential downpour), (post-downpour squalling,
cold), all the seastorm types between and at once, ,
, , (mild and intermediate cold gusting, regular and
syncopated cab-drumming), (breezy droplets), and now his least
favourite of all, .
Rain type was a dirty blatter battering against his windscreen
so hard that it didn't make much odds whether he had his wipers
on or off.
He tested this theory by turning them off briefly, but as it
turned out the visibility did get quite a lot worse. It just
failed to get better again when he turned them back on.
In fact one of the wiper blades began to flap off.
Swish swish swish flop swish flop swish swish flop swish flop
swish flop flop flop scrape.
He pounded his steering wheel, kicked the floor, thumped his
cassette player till it suddenly started playing Barry Manilow,
thumped it again till it stopped, and swore and swore and swore
and swore and swore.
It was at the very moment that his fury was peaking that there
loomed swimmingly in his headlights, hardly visible through the
blatter, a figure by the roadside.
A poor bedraggled figure, strangely attired, wetter than an otter
in a washing machine, and hitching.
"Poor miserable sod," thought Rob McKeena to himself, realizing
that here was somebody with a better right to feel hard done by
than himself, "must be chilled to the bone. Stupid to be out
hitching on a filthy night like this. All you get is cold, wet,
and lorries driving through puddles at you."
He shook his head grimly, heaved another sigh, gave the wheel a
turn and hit a large sheet of water square on.
"See what I mean?" he thought to himself as he ploughed swiftly
through it. "You get some right bastards on the road."
Splattered in his rear mirror a couple of seconds later was the
reflection of the hitch-hiker, drenched by the roadside.
For a moment he felt good about this. A moment or two later he
felt bad about feeling good about it. Then he felt good about
feeling bad about feeling good about it and, satisfied, drove on
into the night.
At least it made up for having been finally overtaken by that
Porsche he had been diligently blocking for the last twenty
miles.
And as he drove on, the rainclouds dragged down the sky after
him, for, though he did not know it, Rob McKeena was a Rain God.
All he knew was that his working days were miserable and he had a
succession of lousy holidays. All the clouds knew was that they
loved him and wanted to be near him, to cherish him, and to water
him.
The next two lorries were not driven by Rain Gods, but they did
exactly the same thing.
The figure trudged, or rather sloshed, onwards till the hill
resumed and the treacherous sheet of water was left behind.
After a while the rain began to ease and the moon put in a brief
appearance from behind the clouds.
A Renault drove by, and its driver made frantic and complex
signals to the trudging figure to indicate that he would have
been delighted to give the figure a lift, only he couldn't this
time because he wasn't going in the direction that the figure
wanted to go, whatever direction that might be, and he was sure
the figure would understand. He concluded the signalling with a
cheery thumbs-up sign, as if to say that he hoped the figure felt
really fine about being cold and almost terminally wet, and he
would catch him the next time around.
The figure trudged on. A Fiat passed and did exactly the same as
the Renault.
A Maxi passed on the other side of the road and flashed its
lights at the slowly plodding figure, though whether this was
meant to convey a "Hello" or a "Sorry we're going the other way"
or a "Hey look, there's someone in the rain, what a jerk" was
entirely unclear. A green strip across the top of the windscreen
indicated that whatever the message was, it came from Steve and
Carola.
The storm had now definitely abated, and what thunder there was
now grumbled over more distant hills, like a man saying "And
another thing ..." twenty minutes after admitting he's lost the
argument.
The air was clearer now, the night cold. Sound travelled rather
well. The lost figure, shivering desperately, presently reached a
junction, where a side road turned off to the left. Opposite the
turning stood a signpost which the figure suddenly hurried to and
studied with feverish curiosity, only twisting away from it as
another car passed suddenly.
And another.
The first whisked by with complete disregard, the second flashed
meaninglessly. A Ford Cortina passed and put on its brakes.
Lurching with surprise, the figure bundled his bag to his chest
and hurried forward towards the car, but at the last moment the
Cortina span its wheels in the wet and carreered off up the road
rather amusingly.
The figure slowed to a stop and stood there, lost and dejected.
As it chanced, the following day the driver of the Cortina went
into hospital to have his appendix out, only due to a rather
amusing mix up the surgeon removed his leg in error, and before
the appendectomy could be rescheduled, the appendicitis
complicated into an entertainingly serious case of peritonitis
and justice, in its way, was served.
The figure trudged on.
A Saab drew to a halt beside him.
Its window wound down and a friendly voice said, "Have you come
far?"
The figure turned toward it. He stopped and grasped the handle of
the door.
The figure, the car and its door handle were all on a planet
called the Earth, a world whose entire entry in the Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy comprised the two words "Mostly harmless".
The man who wrote this entry was called Ford Prefect, and he was
at this precise moment on a far from harmless world, sitting in a
far from harmless bar, recklessly causing trouble.
Whether it was because he was drunk, ill or suicidally insane
would not have been apparent to a casual observer, and indeed
there were no casual observers in the Old Pink Dog Bar on the
lower South Side of Han Dold City because it wasn't the sort of
place you could afford to do things casually in if you wanted to
stay alive. Any observers in the place would have been mean
hawklike observers, heavily armed, with painful throbbings in
their heads which caused them to do crazy things when they
observed things they didn't like.
One of those nasty hushes had descended on the place, a sort of
missile crisis sort of hush.
Even the evil-looking bird perched on a rod in the bar had
stopped screeching out the names and addresses of local contract
killers, which was a service it provided for free.
All eyes were on Ford Prefect. Some of them were on stalks.
The particular way in which he was choosing to dice recklessly
with death today was by trying to pay for a drinks bill the size
of a small defence budget with an American Express Card, which
was not acceptable anywhere in the known Universe.
"What are you worried about?" he asked in a cheery kind of voice.
"The expiration date? Have you guys never heard of Neo-Relativity
out here? There's whole new areas of physics which can take care
of this sort of thing. Time dilation effects, temporal
relastatics ..."
"We are not worried about the expiration date," said the man to
whom he addressed these remarks, who was a dangerous barman in a
dangerous city. His voice was a low soft purr, like the low soft
purr made by the opening of an ICBM silo. A hand like a side of
meat tapped on the bar top, lightly denting it.
"Well, that's good then," said Ford, packing his satchel and
preparing to leave.
The tapping finger reached out and rested lightly on the shoulder
of Ford Prefect. It prevented him from leaving.
Although the finger was attached to a slablike hand, and the hand
was attached to a clublike forearm, the forearm wasn't attached
to anything at all, except in the metaphorical sense that it was
attached by a fierce doglike loyalty to the bar which was its
home. It had previously been more conventionally attached to the
original owner of the bar, who on his deathbed had unexpectedly
bequeathed it to medical science. Medical science had decided
they didn't like the look of it and had bequeathed it right back
to the Old Pink Dog Bar.
The new barman didn't believe in the supernatural or poltergeists
or anything kooky like that, he just knew an useful ally when he
saw one. The hand sat on the bar. It took orders, it served
drinks, it dealt murderously with people who behaved as if they
wanted to be murdered. Ford Prefect sat still.
"We are not worried about the expiration date," repeated the
barman, satisfied that he now had Ford Prefect's full attention.
"We are worried about the entire piece of plastic."
"What?" said Ford. He seemed a little taken aback.
"This," said the barman, holding out the card as if it was a
small fish whose soul had three weeks earlier winged its way to
the Land Where Fish are Eternally Blessed, "we don't accept it."
Ford wondered briefly whether to raise the fact that he didn't
have any other means of payment on him, but decided for the
moment to soldier on. The disembodied hand was now grasping his
shoulder lightly but firmly between its finger and thumb.
"But you don't understand," said Ford, his expression slowly
ripening from a little taken abackness into rank incredulity.
"This is the American Express Card. It is the finest way of
settling bills known to man. Haven't you read their junk mail?"
The cheery quality of Ford's voice was beginning to grate on the
barman's ears. It sounded like someone relentlessly playing the
kazoo during one of the more sombre passages of a War Requiem.
One of the bones in Ford's shoulder began to grate against
another one of the bones in his shoulder in a way which suggested
that the hand had learnt the principles of pain from a highly
skilled chiropracter. He hoped he could get this business settled
before the hand started to grate one of the bones in his shoulder
against any of the bones in different parts of his body. Luckily,
the shoulder it was holding was not the one he had his satchel
slung over.
The barman slid the card back across the bar at Ford.
"We have never," he said with muted savagery, "heard of this
thing."
This was hardly surprising.
Ford had only acquired it through a serious computer error
towards the end of the fifteen years' sojourn he had spent on the
planet Earth. Exactly how serious, the American Express Company
had got to know very rapidly, and the increasingly strident and
panic-stricken demands of its debt collection department were
only silenced by the unexpected demolition of the entire planet
by the Vogons to make way for a new hyperspace bypass.
He had kept it ever since because he found it useful to carry a
form of currency that no one would accept.
"Credit?" he said. "Aaaargggh ..."
These two words were usually coupled together in the Old Pink Dog
Bar.
"I thought," gasped Ford, "that this was meant to be a class
establishment ..."
He glanced around at the motley collection of thugs, pimps and
record company executives that skulked on the edges of the dim
pools of light with which the dark shadows of the bar's inner
recesses were pitted. They were all very deliberately looking in
any direction but his now, carefully picking up the threads of
their former conversations about murders, drug rings and music
publishing deals. They knew what would happen now and didn't want
to watch in case it put them off their drinks.
"You gonna die, boy," the barman murmured quietly at Ford
Prefect, and the evidence was on his side. The bar used to have
one of those signs hanging up which said, "Please don't ask for
credit as a punch in the mouth often offends", but in the
interest of strict accuracy this was altered to, "Please don't
ask for credit because having your throat torn out by a savage
bird while a disembodied hand smashes your head against the bar
often offends". However, this made an unreadable mess of the
notice, and anyway didn't have the same ring to it, so it was
taken down again. It was felt that the story would get about of
its own accord, and it had.
"Lemme look at the bill again," said Ford. He picked it up and
studied it thoughtfully under the malevolent gaze of the barman,
and the equally malevolent gaze of the bird, which was currently
gouging great furrows in the bar top with its talons.
It was a rather lengthy piece of paper.
At the bottom of it was a number which looked like one of those
serial numbers you find on the underside of stereo sets which
always takes so long to copy on to the registration form. He had,
after all, been in the bar all day, he had been drinking a lot of
stuff with bubbles in it, and he had bought an awful lot of
rounds for all the pimps, thugs and record executives who
suddenly couldn't remember who he was.
He cleared his throat rather quietly and patted his pockets.
There was, as he knew, nothing in them. He rested his left hand
lightly but firmly on the half-opened flap of his satchel. The
disembodied hand renewed its pressure on his right shoulder.
"You see," said the barman, and his face seemed to wobble evilly
in front of Ford's, "I have a reputation to think of. You see
that, don't you?"
This is it, thought Ford. There was nothing else for it. He had
obeyed the rules, he had made a bona fide attempt to pay his
bill, it had been rejected. He was now in danger of his life.
"Well," he said quietly, "if it's your reputation ..."
With a sudden flash of speed he opened his satchel and slapped
down on the bar top his copy of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the
Galaxy and the official card which said that he was a field
researcher for the Guide and absolutely not allowed to do what he
was now doing.
"Want a write-up?"
The barman's face stopped in mid-wobble. The bird's talons
stopped in mid-furrow. The hand slowly released its grip.
"That," said the barman in a barely audible whisper, from between
dry lips, "will do nicely, sir."
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a powerful organ.
Indeed, its influence is so prodigious that strict rules have had
to be drawn up by its editorial staff to prevent its misuse. So
none of its field researchers are allowed to accept any kind of
services, discounts or preferential treatment of any kind in
return for editorial favours unless: 
Since invoking the third rule always involved giving the editor a
cut, Ford always preferred to much about with the first two.
He stepped out along the street, walking briskly.
The air was stifling, but he liked it because it was stifling
city air, full of excitingly unpleasant smells, dangerous music
and the sound of warring police tribes.
He carried his satchel with an easy swaying motion so that he
could get a good swing at anybody who tried to take it from him
without asking. It contained everything he owned, which at the
moment wasn't much.
A limousine careered down the street, dodging between the piles
of burning garbage, and frightening an old pack animal which
lurched, screeching, out of its way, stumbled against the window
of a herbal remedies shop, set off a wailing alarm, blundered off
down the street, and then pretended to fall down the steps of a
small pasta restaurant where it knew it would get photographed
and fed.
Ford was walking north. He thought he was probably on his way to
the spaceport, but he had thought that before. He knew he was
going through that part of the city where people's plans often
changed quite abruptly.
"Do you want to have a good time?" said a voice from a doorway.
"As far as I can tell," said Ford, "I'm having one. Thanks."
"Are you rich?" said another.
This made Ford laugh.
He turned and opened his arms in a wide gesture. "Do I look
rich?" he said.
"Don't know," said the girl. "Maybe, maybe not. Maybe you'll get
rich. I have a very special service for rich people ..."
"Oh yes?" said Ford, intrigued but careful. "And what's that?"
"I tell them it's OK to be rich."
Gunfire erupted from a window high above them, but it was only a
bass player getting shot for playing the wrong riff three times
in a row, and bass players are two a penny in Han Dold City.
Ford stopped and peered into the dark doorway.
"You what?" he said.
The girl laughed and stepped forward a little out of the shadow.
She was tall, and had that kind of self-possessed shyness which
is a great trick if you can do it.
"It's my big number," she said. "I have a Master's degree in
Social Economics and can be very convincing. People love it.
Especially in this city."
"Goosnargh," said Ford Prefect, which was a special Betelgeusian
word he used when he knew he should say something but didn't know
what it should be.
He sat on a step, took from his satchel a bottle of that Ol' Janx
Spirit and a towel. He opened the bottle and wiped the top of it
with the towel, which had the opposite effect to the one
intended, in that the Ol' Janx Spirit instantly killed off
millions of the germs which had been slowly building up quite a
complex and enlightened civilization on the smellier patches of
the towel.
"Want some?" he said, after he'd had a swig himself.
She shrugged and took the proffered bottle.
They sat for a while, peacefully listening to the clamour of
burglar alarms in the next block.
"As it happens, I'm owed a lot of money," said Ford, "so if I
ever get hold of it, can I come and see you then maybe?"
"Sure, I'll be here," said the girl. "So how much is a lot?"
"Fifteen years' back pay."
"For?"
"Writing two words."
"Zarquon," said the girl. "Which one took the time?"
"The first one. Once I'd got that the second one just came one
afternoon after lunch."
A huge electronic drum kit hurtled through the window high above
them and smashed itself to bits in the street in front of them.
It soon became apparent that some of the burglar alarms on the
next block had been deliberately set off by one police tribe in
order to lay an ambush for the other. Cars with screaming sirens
converged on the area, only to find themselves being picked off
by copters which came thudding through the air between the city's
mountainous tower blocks.
"In fact," said Ford, having to shout now above the din, "it
wasn't quite like that. I wrote an awful lot, but they just cut
it down."
He took his copy of the Guide back out of his satchel.
"Then the planet got demolished," he shouted. "Really worthwhile
job, eh? They've still got to pay me, though."
"You work for that thing?" the girl yelled back.
"Yeah."
"Good number."
"You want to see the stuff I wrote?" he shouted. "Before it gets
erased? The new revisions are due to be released tonight over the
net. Someone must have found out that the planet I spent fifteen
years on has been demolished by now. They missed it on the last
few revisions, but it can't escape their notice for ever."
"It's getting impossible to talk isn't it?"
"What?"
She shrugged and pointed upwards.
There was a copter above them now which seemed to be involved in
a side skirmish with the band upstairs. Smoke was billowing from
the building. The sound engineer was hanging out of the window by
his fingertips, and a maddened guitarist was beating on his
fingers with a burning guitar. The helicopter was firing at all
of them.
"Can we move?"
They wandered down the street, away from the noise. They ran into
a street theatre group which tried to do a short play for them
about the problems of the inner city, but then gave up and
disappeared into the small restaurant most recently patronized by
the pack animal.
All the time, Ford was poking at the interface panel of the
Guide. They ducked into an alleyway. Ford squatted on a garbage
can while information began to flood over the screen of the
Guide.
He located his entry.
"Earth: Mostly harmless."
Almost immediately the screen became a mass of system messages.
"Here it comes," he said.
"Please wait," said the messages. "Entries are being updated over
the Sub.Etha Net. This entry is being revised. The system will be
down for ten seconds."
At the end of the alley a steel grey limousine crawled past.
"Hey look," said the girl, "if you get paid, look me up. I'm a
working girl, and there are people over there who need me. I
gotta go."
She brushed aside Ford's half-articulated protests, and left him
sitting dejectedly on his garbage can preparing to watch a large
swathe of his working life being swept away electronically into
the ether.
Out in the street things had calmed down a little. The police
battle had moved off to other sectors of the city, the few
surviving members of the rock band had agreed to recognize their
musical differences and pursue solo careers, the street theatre
group were re-emerging from the pasta restaurant with the pack
animal, telling it they would take it to a bar they knew where it
would be treated with a little respect, and a little way further
on the steel grey limousine was parked silently by the kerbside.
The girl hurried towards it.
Behind her, in the darkness of the alley, a green flickering glow
was bathing Ford Prefect's face, and his eyes were slowly
widening in astonishment.
For where he had expected to find nothing, an erased, closed-off
entry, there was instead a continuous stream of data - text,
diagrams, figures and images, moving descriptions of surf on
Australian beaches, Yoghurt on Greek islands, restaurants to
avoid in Los Angeles, currency deals to avoid in Istanbul,
weather to avoid in London, bars to go everywhere. Pages and
pages of it. It was all there, everything he had written.
With a deepening frown of blank incomprehension he went backwards
and forwards through it, stopping here and there at various
entries.
"Tips for aliens in New York: Land anywhere, Central Park,
anywhere. No one will care, or indeed even notice.
"Surviving: get a job as cab driver immediately. A cab driver's
job is to drive people anywhere they want to go in big yellow
machines called taxis. Don't worry if you don't know how the
machine works and you can't speak the language, don't understand
the geography or indeed the basic physics of the area, and have
large green antennae growing out of your head. Believe me, this
is the best way of staying inconspicuous.
"If your body is really weird try showing it to people in the
streets for money.
"Amphibious life forms from any of the worlds in the Swulling,
Noxios or Nausalia systems will particularly enjoy the East
River, which is said to be richer in those lovely life-giving
nutrients then the finest and most virulent laboratory slime yet
achieved.
"Having fun: This is the big section. It is impossible to have
more fun without electrocuting your pleasure centres ..."
Ford flipped the switch which he saw was now marked "Mode Execute
Ready" instead of the now old-fashioned "Access Standby" which
had so long ago replaced the appallingly stone-aged "Off".
This was a planet he had seen completely destroyed, seen with his
own two eyes or rather, blinded as he had been by the hellish
disruption of air and light, felt with his own two feet as the
ground had started to pound at him like a hammer, bucking,
roaring, gripped by tidal waves of energy pouring out of the
loathsome yellow Vogon ships. And then at last, five seconds
after the moment he had determined as being the last possible
moment had already passed, the gently swinging nausea of
dematerialization as he and Arthur Dent had been beamed up
through the atmosphere like a sports broadcast.
There was no mistake, there couldn't have been. The Earth had
definitely been destroyed. Definitely, definitely. Boiled away
into space.
And yet here - he activated the Guide again - was his own entry
on how you would set about having a good time in Bournemouth,
Dorset, England, which he had always prided himself on as being
one of the most baroque pieces of invention he had ever
delivered. He read it again and shook his head in sheer wonder.
Suddenly he realized what the answer to the problem was, and it
was this, that something very weird was happening; and if
something very weird was happening, he thought, he wanted it to
be happening to him.
He stashed the Guide back in his satchel and hurried out on to
the street again.
Walking north he again passed a steel grey limousine parked by
the kerbside, and from a nearby doorway he heard a soft voice
saying, "It's OK, honey, it's really OK, you got to learn to feel
good about it. Look at the way the whole economy is structured
..."
Ford grinned, detoured round the next block which was now in
flames, found a police helicopter which was standing unattended
in the street, broke into it, strapped himself in, crossed his
fingers and sent it hurtling inexpertly into the sky.
He weaved terrifyingly up through the canyoned walls of the city,
and once clear of them, hurtled through the black and red pall of
smoke which hung permanently above it.
Ten minutes later, with all the copter's sirens blaring and its
rapid-fire cannon blasting at random into the clouds, Ford
Prefect brought it careering down among the gantries and landing
lights at Han Dold spaceport, where it settled like a gigantic,
startled and very noisy gnat.
Since he hadn't damaged it too much he was able to trade it in
for a first class ticket on the next ship leaving the system, and
settled into one of its huge, voluptuous body-hugging seats.
This was going to be fun, he thought to himself, as the ship
blinked silently across the insane distances of deep space and
the cabin service got into its full extravagant swing.
"Yes please," he said to the cabin attendants whenever they
glided up to offer him anything at all.
He smiled with a curious kind of manic joy as he flipped again
through the mysteriously re-instated entry on the planet Earth.
He had a major piece of unfinished business that he would now be
able to attend to, and was terribly pleased that life had
suddenly furnished him with a serious goal to achieve.
It suddenly occurred to him to wonder where Arthur Dent was, and
if he knew.
Arthur Dent was one thousand, four hundred and thirty-seven light
years away in a Saab, and anxious.
Behind him in the backseat was a girl who had made him crack his
head on the door as he climbed in. He didn't know if it was just
because she was the first female of his own species that he had
laid eyes on in years, or what it was, but he felt stupefied
with, with ... This is absurd, he told himself. Calm down, he
told himself. You are not, he continued to himself in the firmest
internal voice he could muster, in a fit and rational state. You
have just hitch-hiked over a hundred thousand light years across
the galaxy, you are very tired, a little confused and extremely
vulnerable. Relax, don't panic, concentrate on breathing deeply.
He twisted round in his seat.
"Are you sure she's all right?" he said again.
Beyond the fact that she was, to him, heartthumpingly beautiful,
he could make out very little, how tall she was, how old she was,
the exact shading of her hair. And nor could he ask her anything
about herself because, sadly, she was completely unconscious.
"She's just drugged," said her brother, shrugging, not moving his
eyes from the road ahead.
"And that's all right, is it?" said Arthur, in alarm.
"Suits me," he said.
"Ah," said Arthur. "Er," he added after a moment's thought.
The conversation so far had been going astoundingly badly.
After an initial flurry of opening hellos, he and Russell - the
wonderful girl's brother's name was Russell, a name which, to
Arthur's mind, always suggested burly men with blond moustaches
and blow-dried hair, who would at the slightest provocation start
wearing velvet tuxedos and frilly shirtfronts and would then have
to be forcibly restrained from commentating on snooker matches -
had quickly discovered they didn't like each other at all.
Russell was a burly man. He had a blond moustache. His hair was
fine and blow dried. To be fair to him - though Arthur didn't see
any necessity for this beyond the sheer mental exercise of it -
he, Arthur, was looking pretty grim himself. A man can't cross a
hundred thousand light years, mostly in other people's baggage
compartments, without beginning to fray a little, and Arthur had
frayed a lot.
"She's not a junkie," said Russell suddenly, as if he clearly
thought that someone else in the car might be. "She's under
sedation."
"But that's terrible," said Arthur, twisting round to look at her
again. She seemed to stir slightly and her head slipped sideways
on her shoulder. Her dark hair fell across her face, obscuring
it.
"What's the matter with her, is she ill?"
"No," said Russell, "merely barking mad."
"What?" said Arthur, horrified.
"Loopy, completely bananas. I'm taking her back to the hospital
and telling them to have another go. They let her out while she
still thought she was a hedgehog."
"A hedgehog?"
Russell hooted his horn fiercely at the car that came round the
corner towards them half-way on to their side of the road, making
them swerve. The anger seemed to make him feel better.
"Well, maybe not a hedgehog," he said after he'd settled down
again. "Though it would probably be simpler to deal with if she
did. If somebody thinks they're a hedgehog, presumably you just
give 'em a mirror and a few pictures of hedgehogs and tell them
to sort it out for themselves, come down again when they feel
better. At least medical science could deal with it, that's the
point. Seems that's no good enough for Fenny, though."
"Fenny ...?"
"You know what I got her for Christmas?"
"Well, no."
"Black's Medical Dictionary."
"Nice present."
"I thought so. Thousands of diseases in it, all in alphabetical
order."
"You say her name is Fenny?"
"Yeah. Take your pick, I said. Anything in here can be dealt
with. The proper drugs can be prescribed. But no, she has to have
something different. Just to make life difficult. She was like
that at school, you know."
"Was she?"
"She was. Fell over playing hockey and broke a bone nobody had
ever heard of."
"I can see how that would be irritating," said Arthur doubtfully.
He was rather disappointed to discover her name was Fenny. It was
a rather silly, dispiriting name, such as an unlovely maiden aunt
might vote herself if she couldn't sustain the name Fenella
properly.
"Not that I wasn't sympathetic," continued Russell, "but it did
get a bit irritating. She was limping for months."
He slowed down.
"This is your turning isn't it?"
"Ah, no," said Arthur, "five miles further on. If that's all
right."
"OK," said Russell after a very tiny pause to indicate that it
wasn't, and speeded up again.
It was in fact Arthur's turning, but he couldn't leave without
finding out something more about this girl who seemed to have
taken such a grip on his mind without even waking up. He could
take either of the next two turnings.
They led back to the village that had been his home, though what
he would find there he hesitated to imagine. Familiar landmarks
had been flitting by, ghostlike, in the dark, giving rise to the
shudders that only very very normal things can create, when seen
where the mind is unprepared for them, and in an unfamiliar
light.
By his own personal time scale, so far as he could estimate it,
living as he had been under the alien rotations of distant suns,
it was eight years since he had left, but what time had passed
here he could hardly guess. Indeed, what events had passed were
beyond his exhausted comprehension because this planet, his home,
should not be here.
Eight years ago, at lunchtime, this planet had been demolished,
utterly destroyed, by the huge yellow Vogon ships which had hung
in the lunchtime sky as if the law of gravity was no more than a
local regulation, and breaking it no more than a parking offence.
"Delusions," said Russell.
"What?" said Arthur, started out of his train of thought.
"She says she suffers from strange delusions that she's living in
the real world. It's no good telling her that she is living in
the real world because she just says that's why the delusions are
so strange. Don't know about you, but I find that kind of
conversation pretty exhausting. Give her the tablets and piss off
for a beer is my answer. I mean you can only muck about so much
can't you?"
Arthur frowned, not for the first time.
"Well ..."
"And all this dreams and nightmare stuff. And the doctors going
on about strange jumps in her brainwave patterns."
"Jumps?"
"This," said Fenny.
Arthur whirled round in his seat and stared into her suddenly
open but utterly vacant eyes. Whatever she was looking at wasn't
in the car. Her eyes fluttered, her head jerked once, and then
she was sleeping peacefully.
"What did she say?" he asked anxiously.
"She said this'."
"This what?"
"This what? How the heck should I know? This hedgehog, that
chimney pot, the other pair of Don Alfonso's tweezers. She's
barking mad, I thought I'd mentioned that."
"You don't seem to care very much." Arthur tried to say it as
matter-of-factly as possible but it didn't seem to work.
"Look, buster ..."
"OK, I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean it to
sound like that," said Arthur. "I know you care a lot,
obviously," he added, lying. "I know that you have to deal with
it somehow. You'll have to excuse me. I just hitched from the
other side of the Horsehead Nebula."
He stared furiously out of the window.
He was astonished that of all the sensations fighting for room in
his head on this night as he returned to the home that he had
thought had vanished into oblivion for ever, the one that was
compelling him was an obsession with this bizarre girl of whom he
knew nothing other than that she had said "this" to him, and that
he wouldn't wish her brother on a Vogon.
"So, er, what were the jumps, these jumps you mentioned?" he went
on to say as quickly as he could.
"Look, this is my sister, I don't even know why I'm talking to
you about ..."
"OK, I'm sorry. Perhaps you'd better let me out. This is ..."
At the moment he said it, it became impossible, because the storm
which had passed them by suddenly erupted again. Lightning belted
through the sky, and someone seemed to be pouring something which
closely resembled the Atlantic Ocean over them through a sieve.
Russell swore and steered intently for a few seconds as the sky
blattered at them. He worked out his anger by rashly accelerating
to pass a lorry marked "McKeena's All-Weather Haulage". The
tension eased as the rain subsided.
"It started with all that business of the CIA agent they found in
the reservoir, when everybody had all the hallucinations and
everything, you remember?"
Arthur wondered for a moment whether to mention again that he had
just hitch-hiked back from the other side of the Horsehead Nebula
and was for this and various other related and astounding reasons
a little out of touch with recent events, but he decided it would
only confuse matters further.
"No," he said.
"That was the moment she cracked up. She was in a cafe somewhere.
Rickmansworth. Don't know what she was doing there, but that was
where she cracked up. Apparently she stood up, calmly announced
that she had undergone some extraordinary revelation or
something, wobbled a bit, looked confused, and finally collapsed
screaming into an egg sandwich."
Arthur winced. "I'm very sorry to hear that," he said a little
stiffly.
Russell made a sort of grumping noise.
"So what," said Arthur in an attempt to piece things together,
"was the CIA agent doing in the reservoir?"
"Bobbing up and down of course. He was dead."
"But what ..."
"Come on, you remember all that stuff. The hallucinations.
Everyone said it was a cock up, the CIA trying experiments into
drug warfare or something. Some crackpot theory that instead of
invading a country it would be much cheaper and more effective to
make everyone think they'd been invaded."
"What hallucinations were those exactly ...?" said Arthur in a
rather quiet voice.
"What do you mean, what hallucinations? I'm talking about all
that stuff with the big yellow ships, everyone going crazy and
saying we're going to die, and then pop, they vanished as the
effect wore off. The CIA denied it which meant it must be true."
Arthur's head went a little swimmy. His hand grabbed at something
to steady himself, and gripped it tightly. His mouth made little
opening and closing movements as if it was on his mind to say
something, but nothing emerged.
"Anyway," continued Russell, "whatever drug it was it didn't seem
to wear off so fast with Fenny. I was all for suing the CIA, but
a lawyer friend of mine said it would be like trying to attack a
lunatic asylum with a banana, so ..." He shrugged.
"The Vogon ..." squeaked Arthur. "The yellow ships ... vanished?"
"Well, of course they did, they were hallucinations," said
Russell, and looked at Arthur oddly. "You trying to say you don't
remember any of this? Where have you been for heaven's sake?"
This was, to Arthur, such an astonishingly good question that he
half-leapt out of his seat with shock.
"Christ!!!" yelled Russell, fighting to control the car which was
suddenly trying to skid. He pulled it out of the path of an
oncoming lorry and swerved up on to a grass bank. As the car
lurched to a halt, the girl in the back was thrown against
Russell's seat and collapsed awkwardly.
Arthur twisted round in horror.
"Is she all right?" he blurted out.
Russell swept his hands angrily back through his blow-dried hair.
He tugged at his blond moustache. He turned to Arthur.
"Would you please," he said, "let go of the handbrake?"
From here it was a four-mile walk to his village: a further mile
to the turning, to which the abominable Russell had now fiercely
declined to take him, and from there a further three miles of
winding country lane.
The Saab seethed off into the night. Arthur watched it go, as
stunned as a man might be who, having believed himself to be
totally blind for five years, suddenly discovers that he had
merely been wearing too large a hat.
He shook his head sharply in the hope that it might dislodge some
salient fact which would fall into place and make sense of an
otherwise utterly bewildering Universe, but since the salient
fact, if there was one, entirely failed to do this, he set off up
the road again, hoping that a good vigorous walk, and maybe even
some good painful blisters, would help to reassure him of his own
existence at least, if not his sanity.
It was . when he arrived, a fact he discovered from the
steamed and greasy window of the Horse and Groom pub, in which
there had hung for many years a battered old Guiness clock which
featured a picture of an emu with a pint glass jammed rather
amusingly down its throat.
This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime
during which first his house and then the entire planet Earth had
been demolished, or rather had seemed to be demolished. No, damn
it, had been demolished, because if it hadn't then where the
bloody heck had he been for the last eight years, and how he had
got there if not in one of the big yellow Vogon ships which the
appalling Russell had just been telling him were merely drug-
induced hallucinations, and yet if it had been demolished, what
was he currently standing on ...?
He jammed the brake on this line of thought because it wasn't
going to get him any further than it had the last twenty times
he'd been over it.
He started again.
This was the pub at which he had passed the fateful lunchtime
during which whatever it was had happened that he was going to
sort out later had happened, and ...
It still didn't make sense.
He started again.
This was the pub in which ...
This was a pub.
Pubs served drinks and he couldn't half do with one.
Satisfied that his jumbled thought processes had at last arrived
at a conclusion, and a conclusion he was happy with, even if it
wasn't the one he had set out to achieve, he strode towards the
door.
And stopped.
A small black wire-haired terrier ran out from behind a low wall
and then, catching sight of Arthur, began to snarl.
Now Arthur knew this dog, and he knew it well. It belonged to an
advertising friend of his, and was called Know-Nothing-Bozo
because the way its hair stood up on its head it reminded people
of the President of the United States, and the dog knew Arthur,
or at least should do. It was a stupid dog, could not even read
an autocue, which way why some people had protested about its
name, but it should at least have been able to recognize Arthur
instead of standing there, hackles raised, as if Arthur was the
most fearful apparition ever to intrude upon its feeble-witted
life.
This prompted Arthur to go and peer at the window again, this
time with an eye not for the asphyxiating emu but for himself.
Seeing himself for the first time suddenly in a familiar context,
he had to admit that the dog had a point.
He looked a lot like something a farmer would use to scare birds
with, and there was no doubt but that to go into the pub in his
present condition would excite comments of a raucous kind, and
worse still, there would doubtless be several people in there at
the moment whom he knew, all of whom would be bound to bombard
him with questions which, at the moment, he felt ill-equipped to
deal with.
Will Smithers, for instance, the owner of Know-Nothing-Bozo the
Non-Wonder Dog, an animal so stupid that it had been sacked from
one of Will's own commercials for being incapable of knowing
which dog food it was supposed to prefer, despite the fact that
the meat in all the other bowls had had engine oil poured over
it.
Will would definitely be in there. Here was his dog, here was his
car, a grey Porsche S with a sign in the back window which
read, "My other car is also a Porsche." Damn him.
He stared at it and realized that he had just learned something
he hadn't known before.
Will Smithers, like most of the overpaid and under-scrupulous
bastards Arthur knew in advertising made a point of changing his
car every August so that he could tell people his accountant made
him do it, though the truth was that his accountant was trying
like hell to stop him, what with all the alimony he had to pay,
and so on - and this was the same car Arthur remembered him
having before. The number plate proclaimed its year.
Given that it was now winter, and that the event which had caused
Arthur so much trouble eight of his personal years ago had
occurred at the beginning of September, less than six or seven
months could have passed here.
He stood terribly still for a moment and let Know-Nothing-Bozo
jump up and down yapping at him. He was suddenly stunned by a
realization he could no longer avoid, which was this: he was now
an alien on his own world. Try as he might, no one was even to be
able to believe his story. Not only did it sound perfectly potty,
but it was flatly contradicted by the simplest observable facts.
Was this really the Earth? Was there the slightest possibility
that he had made some extraordinary mistake?
The pub in front of him was unbearably familiar to him in every
detail - every brick, every piece of peeling paint; and inside he
could sense its familiar stuffy, noisy warmth, its exposed beams,
its unauthentic cast-iron light fittings, its bar sticky with
beer that people he knew had put their elbows in, overlooked by
cardboard cutouts of girls with packets of peanuts stapled all
over their breasts. It was all the stuff of his home, his world.
He even knew this blasted dog.
"Hey, Know-Nothing!"
The sound of Will Smithers' voice meant he had to decide what do
to quickly. If he stood his ground he would be discovered and the
whole circus would begin. To hide would only postpone the moment,
and it was bitterly cold now.
The fact that it was Will made the choice easier. It wasn't that
Arthur disliked him as such - Will was quite fun. It was just
that he was fun in such an exhausting way because, being in
advertising, he always wanted you to know how much fun he was
having and where he had got his jacket from.
Mindful of this, Arthur hid behind a van.
"Hey, Know-Nothing, what's up?"
The door opened and Will came out, wearing a leather flying
jacket that he'd got a mate of his at the Road Research
Laboratory to crash a car into specially, in order to get that
battered look. Know-Nothing yelped with delight and, having got
the attention it wanted, was happy to forget Arthur.
Will was with some friends, and they had a game they played with
the dog.
"Commies!" they all shouted at the dog in chorus. "Commies,
commies, commies!!!"
The dog went berserk with barking, prancing up and down, yapping
its little heart out, beside itself in transports of ecstatic
rage. They all laughed and cheered it on, then gradually
dispersed to their various cars and disappeared into the night.
Well that clears one thing up, thought Arthur from behind the
van, this is quite definitely the planet I remember.
His house was still there.
How or why, he had no idea. He had decided to go and have a look
while he was waiting for the pub to empty, so that he could go
and ask the landlord for a bed for the night when everyone else
had gone. And there it was.
He hurriedly let himself in with the key he kept under a stone
frog in the garden, because, astoundingly, the phone was ringing.
He had heard it faintly all the way up the lane and had started
to run as soon as he realized where the sound was coming from.
The door had to be forced open because of the astonishing
accumulation of junk mail on the doormat. It jammed itself stuck
on what he would later discover were fourteen identical,
personally addressed invitations to apply for a credit card he
already had, seventeen identical threatening letters for non-
payment of bills on a credit card he didn't have, thirty-three
identical letters saying that he personally had been specially
selected as a man of taste and discrimination who knew what he
wanted and where he was going in today's sophisticated jet-
setting world and would he therefore like to buy some grotty
wallet, and also a dead tabby kitten.
He rammed himself through the relatively narrow opening afforded
by all this, stumbled through a pile of wine offers that no
discriminating connoisseur would want to miss, slithered over a
heap of beach villa holidays, blundered up the dark stairs to his
bedroom and got to the phone just as it stopped ringing.
He collapsed, panting, on to his cold, musty-smelling bed and for
a few minutes stopped trying to prevent the world from spinning
round his head in the way it obviously wanted to.
When it had enjoyed its little spin and had calmed down a bit,
Arthur reached out for the bedside light, not expecting it to
come on. To his surprise it did. This appealed to Arthur's sense
of logic. Since the Electricity Board cut him off without fail
every time he paid his bill, it seemed only reasonable that they
should leave him connected when he didn't. Sending them money
obviously only drew attention to yourself.
The room was much as he had left it, i.e. festeringly untidy,
though the effect was muted a little by a thick layer of dust.
Half-read books and magazines nestled amongst piles of half-used
towels. Half pairs of socks reclined in half-drunk cups of
coffee. What was once a half-eaten sandwich had now half-turned
into something that Arthur entirely didn't want to know about.
Bung a fork of lightning through this lot, he thought to himself,
and you'd start the evolution of life all over again.
There was only one thing in the room that was different.
For a moment or so he couldn't see what the one thing that was
different was, because it too was covered in a film of disgusting
dust. Then his eyes caught it and stopped.
It was next to a battered old television on which it was only
possible to watch Open University Study Courses, because if it
tried to show anything more exciting it would break down.
It was a box.
Arthur pushed himself up on his elbows and peered at it.
It was a grey box, with a kind of dull lustre to it. It was a
cubic grey box, just over a foot on a side. It was tied with a
single grey ribbon, knotted into a neat bow on the top.
He got up, walked over and touched it in surprise. Whatever it
was was clearly gift-wrapped, neatly and beautifully, and was
waiting for him to open it.
Cautiously, he picked it up and carried it back to the bed. He
brushed the dust off the top and loosened the ribbon. The top of
the box was a lid, with a flap tucked into the body of the box.
He untucked it and looked into the box. In it was a glass globe,
nestling in fine grey tissue paper. He drew it out, carefully. It
wasn't a proper globe because it was open at the bottom, or, as
Arthur realized turning it over, at the top, with a thick rim. It
was a bowl. A fish bowl.
It was made of the most wonderful glass perfectly transparent,
yet with an extraordinary silver-grey quality as if crystal and
slate had gone into its making.
Arthur slowly turned it over and over in his hands. It was one of
the most beautiful objects he had ever seen, but he was entirely
perplexed by it. He looked into the box, but other than the
tissue paper there was nothing. On the outside of the box there
was nothing.
He turned the bowl round again. It was wonderful. It was
exquisite. But it was a fish bowl.
He tapped it with his thumbnail and it rang with a deep and
glorious chime which was sustained for longer than seemed
possible, and when at last it faded seemed not to die away but to
drift off into other worlds, as into a deep sea dream.
Entranced, Arthur turned it round yet again, and this time the
light from the dusty little bedside lamp caught it at a different
angle and glittered on some fine abrasions on the fish bowl's
surface. He held it up, adjusting the angle to the light, and
suddenly saw clearly the finely engraved shapes of words shadowed
on the glass.
"So Long," they said, "and Thanks ..."
And that was all. He blinked, and understood nothing.
For fully five more minutes he turned the object round and
around, held it to the light at different angles, tapped it for
its mesmerizing chime and pondered on the meaning of the shadowy
letters but could find none. Finally he stood up, filled the bowl
with water from the tap and put it back on the table next to the
television. He shook the little Babel fish from his ear and
dropped it, wriggling, into the bowl. He wouldn't be needing it
any more, except for watching foreign movies.
He returned to lie on his bed, and turned out the light.
He lay still and quiet. He absorbed the enveloping darkness,
slowly relaxed his limbs from end to end, eased and regulated his
breathing, gradually cleared his mind of all thought, closed his
eyes and was completely incapable of getting to sleep.
The night was uneasy with rain. The rain clouds themselves had
now moved on and were currently concentrating their attention on
a small transport cafe just outside Bournemouth, but the sky
through which they had passed had been disturbed by them and now
wore a damply ruffled air, as if it didn't know what else it
might not do it further provoked.
The moon was out in a watery way. It looked like a ball of paper
from the back pocket of jeans that have just come out of the
washing machine, and which only time and ironing would tell if it
was an old shopping list or a five pound note.
The wind flicked about a little, like the tail of a horse that's
trying to decide what sort of mood it's in tonight, and a bell
somewhere chimed midnight.
A skylight creaked open.
It was stiff and had to be jiggled and persuaded a little because
the frame was slightly rotten and the hinges had at some time in
its life been rather sensibly painted over, but eventually it was
open.
A strut was found to prop it and a figure struggled out into the
narrow gully between the opposing pitches of the roof.
It stood and watched the sky in silence.
The figure was completely unrecognizable as the wild-looking
creature who had burst crazily into the cottage a little over an
hour ago. Gone was the ragged threadbare dressing gown, smeared
with the mud of a hundred worlds, stained with junk food
condiment from a hundred grimy spaceports, gone was the tangled
mane of hair, gone the long and knotted beard, flourishing
ecosystem and all.
Instead, there was Arthur Dent the smooth and casual, in
corduroys and a chunky sweater. His hair was cropped and washed,
his chin clean shaven. Only the eyes still said that whatever it
was the Universe thought it was doing to him, he would still like
it please to stop.
They were not the same eyes with which he had last looked out at
this particular scene, and the brain which interpreted the images
the eyes resolved was not the same brain. There had been no
surgery involved, just the continual wrenching of experience.
The night seemed like an alive thing to him at this moment, the
dark earth around him a being in which he was rooted.
He could feel like a tingle on distant nerve ends the flood of a
far river, the roll of invisible hills, the knot of heavy
rainclouds parked somewhere away to the south.
He could sense, too, the thrill of being a tree, which was
something he hadn't expected. He knew that it felt good to curl
your toes in the earth, but he'd never realized it could feel
quite as good as that. He could sense an almost unseemly wave of
pleasure reaching out to him all the way from the New Forest. He
must try this summer, he thought, and see what having leaves felt
like.
From another direction he felt the sensation of being a sheep
startled by a flying saucer, but it was virtually
indistinguishable from the feeling of being a sheep startled by
anything else it ever encountered, for they were creatures who
learned very little on their journey through life, and would be
startled to see the sun rising in the morning, and astonished by
all the green stuff in the fields.
He was surprised to find he could feel the sheep being startled
by the sun that morning, and the morning before, and being
startled by a clump of trees the day before that. He could go
further and further back, but it got dull because all it
consisted of was sheep being startled by things they'd been
startled by the day before.
He left the sheep and let his mind drift outwards sleepily in
developing ripples. It felt the presence of other minds, hundreds
of them, thousands in a web, some sleepy, some sleeping, some
terribly excited, one fractured.
One fractured.
He passed it fleetingly and tried to feel for it again, but it
eluded him like the other card with an apple on it in Pelmanism.
He felt a spasm of excitement because he knew instinctively who
it was, or at least knew who it was he wanted it to be, and once
you know what it is you want to be true, instinct is a very
useful device for enabling you to know that it is.
He instinctively knew that it was Fenny and that he wanted to
find her; but he could not. By straining too much for it, he
could feel he was losing this strange new faculty, so he relaxed
the search and let his mind wander more easily once more.
And again, he felt the fracture.
Again he couldn't find it. This time, whatever his instinct was
busy telling him it was all right to believe, he wasn't certain
that it was Fenny - or perhaps it was a different fracture this
time. It had the same disjointed quality but it seemed a more
general feeling of fracture, deeper, not a single mind, maybe not
a mind at all. It was different.
He let his mind sink slowly and widely into the Earth, rippling,
seeping, sinking.
He was following the Earth through its days, drifting with the
rhythms of its myriad pulses, seeping through the webs of its
life, swelling with its tides, turning with its weight. Always
the fracture kept returning, a dull disjointed distant ache.
And now he was flying through a land of light; the light was
time, the tides of it were days receding. The fracture he had
sensed, the second fracture, lay in the distance before him
across the land, the thickness of a single hair across the
dreaming landscape of the days of Earth.
And suddenly he was upon it.
He danced dizzily over the edge as the dreamland dropped sheer
away beneath him, a stupefying precipice into nothing, him wildly
twisting, clawing at nothing, flailing in horrifying space,
spinning, falling.
Across the jagged chasm had been another land, another time, an
older world, not fractured from, but hardly joined: two Earths.
He woke.
A cold breeze brushed the feverish sweat standing on his
forehead. The nightmare was spent and so, he felt, was he. His
shoulders dropped, he gently rubbed his eyes with the tips of his
fingers. At last he was sleepy as well as very tired. As to what
it meant, if it meant anything at all, he would think about it in
the morning; for now he would go to bed and sleep. His own bed,
his own sleep.
He could see his house in the distance and wondered why this was.
It was silhouetted against the moonlight and he recognized its
rather dull blockish shape. He looked about him and noticed that
he was about eighteen inches above the rose bushes of one of his
neighbours, John Ainsworth. His rose bushes were carefully
tended, pruned back for the winter, strapped to canes and
labelled, and Arthur wondered what he was doing above them. He
wondered what was holding him there, and when he discovered that
nothing was holding him there he crashed awkwardly to the ground.
He picked himself up, brushed himself down and hobbled back to
his house on a sprained ankle. He undressed and toppled into bed.
While he was asleep the phone rang again. It rang for fully
fifteen minutes and caused him to turn over twice. It never,
however, stood a chance of waking him up.
Arthur awoke feeling wonderful, absolutely fabulous, refreshed,
overjoyed to be home, bouncing with energy, hardly disappointed
at all to discover it was the middle of February.
He almost danced to the fridge, found the three least hairy
things in it, put them on a plate and watched them intently for
two minutes. Since they made no attempt to move within that time
he called them breakfast and ate them. Between them they killed a
virulent space disease he's picked up without knowing it in the
Flargathon Gas Swamps a few days earlier, which otherwise would
have killed off half the population of the Western Hemisphere,
blinded the other half and driven everyone else psychotic and
sterile, so the Earth was lucky there.
He felt strong, he felt healthy. He vigorously cleared away the
junk mail with a spade and then buried the cat.
Just as he was finishing that, the phone went, but he let it ring
while he maintained a moment's respectful silence. Whoever it was
would ring back if it was important.
He kicked the mud off his shoes and went back inside.
There had been a small number of significant letters in the piles
of junk - some documents from the council, dated three years
earlier, relating to the proposed demolition of his house, and
some other letters about the setting up of a public inquiry into
the whole bypass scheme in the area; there was also an old letter
from Greenpeace, the ecological pressure group to which he
occasionally made contributions, asking for help with their
scheme to release dolphins and orcas from captivity, and some
postcards from friends, vaguely complaining that he never got in
touch these days.
He collected these together and put them in a cardboard file
which he marked "Things To Do". Since he was feeling so vigorous
and dynamic that morning, he even added the word "Urgent!"
He unpacked his towel and another few odd bits and pieces from
the plastic bag he had acquired at the Port Brasta Mega-Market.
The slogan on the side was a clever and elaborate pun in Lingua
Centauri which was completely incomprehensible in any other
language and therefore entirely pointless for a Duty Free Shop at
a spaceport. The bag also had a hole in it so he threw it away.
He realized with a sudden twinge that something else must have
dropped out in the small spacecraft that had brought him to
Earth, kindly going out of its way to drop him right beside the
A. He had lost his battered and spaceworn copy of the thing
which had helped him find his way across the unbelievable wastes
of space he had traversed. He had lost the Hitch Hiker's Guide to
the Galaxy.
Well, he told himself, this time I really won't be needing it
again.
He had some calls to make.
He had decided how to deal with the mass of contradictions his
return journey precipitated, which was that he would simply
brazen it out.
He phoned the BBC and asked to be put through to his department
head.
"Oh, hello, Arthur Dent here. Look, sorry I haven't been in for
six months but I've gone mad."
"Oh, not to worry. Thought it was probably something like that.
Happens here all the time. How soon can we expect you?"
"When do hedgehogs stop hibernating?"
"Sometime in spring I think."
"I'll be in shortly after that."
"Rightyho."
He flipped through the Yellow Pages and made a short list of
numbers to try.
"Oh hello, is that the Old Elms Hospital? Yes, I was just phoning
to see if I could have a word with Fenella, er ... Fenella - Good
Lord, silly me, I'll forget my own name next, er, Fenella - isn't
this ridiculous? Patient of yours, dark haired girl, came in last
night ..."
"I'm afraid we don't have any patients called Fenella."
"Oh, don't you? I mean Fiona of course, we just call her Fen ..."
"I'm sorry, goodbye."
Click.
Six conversations along these lines began to take their toll on
his mood of vigorous, dynamic optimism, and he decided that
before it deserted him entirely he would take it down to the pub
and parade it a little.
He had had the perfect idea for explaining away every
inexplicable weirdness about himself at a stroke, and he whistled
to himself as he pushed open the door which had so daunted him
last night.
"Arthur!!!!"
He grinned cheerfully at the boggling eyes that stared at him
from all corners of the pub, and told them all what a wonderful
time he'd had in Southern California.
He accepted another pint and took a pull at it.
"Of course, I had my own personal alchemist too."
"You what?"
He was getting silly and he knew it. Exuberance and Hall and
Woodhouse best bitter was a mixture to be wary of, but one of the
first effects it had is to stop you being wary of things, and the
point at which Arthur should have stopped and explained no more
was the point at which he started instead to get inventive.
"Oh yes," he insisted with a happy glazed smile. "It's why I've
lost so much weight."
"What?" said his audience.
"Oh yes," he said again. "The Californians have rediscovered
alchemy. Oh yes."
He smiled again.
"Only," he said, "it's in a much more useful form than that which
in ..." He paused thoughtfully to let a little grammar assemble
in his head. "In which the ancients used to practise it. Or at
least," he added, "failed to practise it. They couldn't get it to
work you know. Nostradamus and that lot. Couldn't cut it."
"Nostradamus?" said one of his audience.
"I didn't think he was an alchemist," said another.
"I thought," said a third, "he was a seer."
"He became a seer," said Arthur to his audience, the component
parts of which were beginning to bob and blur a little, "because
he was such a lousy alchemist. You should know that."
He took another pull at his beer. It was something he had not
tasted for eight years. He tasted it and tasted it.
"What has alchemy got to do," asked a bit of the audience, "with
losing weight?"
"I'm glad you asked that," said Arthur. "Very glad. And I will
now tell you what the connection is between ..." He paused.
"Between those two things. The things you mentioned. I'll tell
you."
He paused and manoeuvred his thoughts. It was like watching oil
tankers doing three-point turns in the English Channel.
"They've discovered how to turn excess body fat into gold," he
said, in a sudden blur of coherence.
"You're kidding."
"Oh yes," he said, "no," he corrected himself, "they have."
He rounded on the doubting part of his audience, which was all of
it, and so it took a little while to round on it completely.
"Have you been to California?" he demanded. "Do you know the sort
of stuff they do there?"
Three members of his audience said they had and that he was
talking nonsense.
"You haven't seen anything," insisted Arthur. "Oh yes," he added,
because someone was offering to buy another round.
"The evidence," he said, pointing at himself, and not missing by
more than a couple of inches, "is before your eyes. Fourteen
hours in a trance," he said, "in a tank. In a trance. I was in a
tank. I think," he added after a thoughtful pause, "I already
said that."
He waited patiently while the next round was duly distributed. He
composed the next bit of his story in his mind, which was going
to be something about the tank needing to be orientated along a
line dropped perpendicularly from the Pole Star to a baseline
drawn between Mars and Venus, and was about to start trying to
say it when he decided to give it a miss.
"Long time," he said instead, "in a tank. In a trance." He looked
round severely at his audience, to make sure it was all following
attentively.
He resumed.
"Where was I?" he said.
"In a trance," said one.
"In a tank," said another.
"Oh yes," said Arthur. "Thank you. And slowly," he said pressing
onwards, "slowly, slowly slowly, all your excess body fat ...
turns ... to ..." he paused for effect, "subcoo ... subyoo ...
subtoocay ..." - he paused for breath - "subcutaneous gold, which
you can have surgically removed. Getting out of the tank is hell.
What did you say?"
"I was just clearing my throat."
"I think you doubt me."
"I was clearing my throat."
"She was clearing her throat," confirmed a significant part of
the audience in a low rumble.
"Oh yes," said Arthur, "all right. And you then split the
proceeds ..." he paused again for a maths break, "fifty-fifty
with the alchemist. Make a lot of money!"
He looked swayingly around at his audience, and could not help
but be aware of an air of scepticism about their jumbled faces.
He felt very affronted by this.
"How else," he demanded, "could I afford to have my face
dropped?"
Friendly arms began to help him home. "Listen," he protested, as
the cold February breeze brushed his face, "looking lived-in is
all the rage in California at the moment. You've got to look as
if you've seen the Galaxy. Life, I mean. You've got to look as if
you've seen life. That's what I got. A face drop. Give me eight
years, I said. I hope being thirty doesn't come back into fashion
or I've wasted a lot of money."
He lapsed into silence for a while as the friendly arms continued
to help him along the lane to his house.
"Got in yesterday," he mumbled. "I'm very happy to be home. Or
somewhere very like it ..."
"Jet lag," muttered one of his friends. "Long trip from
California. Really mucks you up for a couple of days."
"I don't think he's been there at all," muttered another. "I
wonder where he has been. And what's happened to him."
After a little sleep Arthur got up and pottered round the house a
bit. He felt woozy and a little low, still disoriented by the
journey. He wondered how he was going to find Fenny.
He sat and looked at the fish bowl. He tapped it again, and
despite being full of water and a small yellow Babel fish which
was gulping its way around rather dejectedly, it still chimed its
deep and resonant chime as clearly and mesmerically as before.
Someone is trying to thank me, he thought to himself. He wondered
who, and for what.
"At the third stroke it will be one ... thirty-two ... and twenty
seconds.
"Beep ... beep ... beep."
Ford Prefect suppressed a little giggle of evil satisfaction,
realized that he had no reason to suppress it, and laughed out
loud, a wicked laugh.
He switched the incoming signal through from the Sub-Etha Net to
the ship's hi-fi system, and the odd, rather stilted, sing-song
voice spoke out with remarkable clarity round the cabin.
"At the third stroke it will be one ... thirty-two ... and thirty
seconds.
"Beep ... beep ... beep."
He tweaked the volume up just a little while keeping a careful
eye on a rapidly changing table of figures on the ship's computer
display. For the length of time he had in mind, the question of
power consumption became significant. He didn't want a murder on
his conscience.
"At the third stroke it will be one ... thirty-two ... and forty
seconds.
"Beep ... beep ... beep."
He checked around the small ship. He walked down the short
corridor. "At the third stroke ..."
He stuck his head into the small, functional, gleaming steel
bathroom.
"it will be ..."
It sounded fine in there.
He looked into the tiny sleeping quarters.
"... one ... thirty-two ..."
It sounded a bit muffled. There was a towel hanging over one of
the speakers. He took down the towel.
"... and fifty seconds."
Fine.
He checked out the packed cargo hold, and wasn't at all satisfied
with the sound. There was altogether too much crated junk in the
way. He stepped back out and waited for the door to seal. He
broke open a closed control panel and pushed the jettison button.
He didn't know why he hadn't thought of that before. A whooshing
rumbling noise died away quickly into silence. After a pause a
slight hiss could be heard again.
It stopped.
He waited for the green light to show and then opened the door
again on the now empty cargo hold.
"... one ... thirty-three ... and fifty seconds."
Very nice.
"Beep ... beep ... beep."
He then went and had a last thorough examination of the emergency
suspended animation chamber, which was where he particularly
wanted it to be heard.
"At the third stroke it will be one ... thirty ... four ...
precisely."
He shivered as he peered down through the heavily frosted
covering at the dim bulk of the form within. One day, who knew
when, it would wake, and when it did, it would know what time it
was. Not exactly local time, true, but what the heck.
He double-checked the computer display above the freezer bed,
dimmed the lights and checked it again.
"At the third stroke it will be ..."
He tiptoed out and returned to the control cabin.
"... one ... thirty-four and twenty seconds."
The voice sounded as clear as if he was hearing it over a phone
in London, which he wasn't, not by a long way.
He gazed out into the inky night. The star the size of a
brilliant biscuit crumb he could see in the distance was
Zondostina, or as it was known on the world from which the rather
stilted, sing-song voice was being received, Pleiades Zeta.
The bright orange curve that filled over half the visible area
was the giant gas planet Sesefras Magna, where the Xaxisian
battleships docked, and just rising over its horizon was a small
cool blue moon, Epun.
"At the third stroke it will be ..."
For twenty minutes he sat and watched as the gap between the ship
and Epun closed, as the ship's computer teased and kneaded the
numbers that would bring it into a loop around the little moon,
close the loop and keep it there, orbiting in perpetual
obscurity.
"One ... fifty-nine ..."
His original plan had been to close down all external signalling
and radiation from the ship, to render it as nearly invisible as
possible unless you were actually looking at it, but then he'd
had an idea he preferred. It would now emit one single continuous
beam, pencil-thin, broadcasting the incoming time signal to the
planet of the signal's origin, which it would not reach for four
hundred years, travelling at light speed, but where it would
probably cause something of a stir when it did.
"Beep ... beep ... beep."
He sniggered.
He didn't like to think of himself as the sort of person who
giggled or sniggered, but he had to admit that he had been
giggling and sniggering almost continuously for well over half an
hour now.
"At the third stroke ..."
The ship was now locked almost perfectly into its perpetual orbit
round a little known and never visited moon. Almost perfect.
One thing only remained. He ran again the computer simulation of
the launching of the ship's little Escape-O-Buggy, balancing
actions, reactions, tangential forces, all the mathematical
poetry of motion, and saw that it was good.
Before he left, he turned out the lights.
As his tiny little cigar tube of an escape craft zipped out on
the beginning of its three-day journey to the orbiting space
station Port Sesefron, it rode for a few seconds a long pencil-
thin beam of radiation that was starting out on a longer journey
still.
"At the third stroke, it will be two ... thirteen ... and fifty
seconds."
He giggled and sniggered. He would have laughed out loud but he
didn't have the room.
"Beep ... beep ... beep."
"April showers I hate especially."
However noncommittally Arthur grunted, the man seemed determined
to talk to him. He wondered if he should get up and move to
another table, but there didn't seem to be one free in the whole
cafeteria. He stirred his coffee fiercely.
"Bloody April showers. Hate hate hate."
Arthur stared, frowning, out of the window. A light, sunny spray
of rain hung over the motorway. Two months he'd been back now.
Slipping back into his old life had in fact been laughably easy.
People had such extraordinarily short memories, including him.
Eight years of crazed wanderings round the Galaxy now seemed to
him not so much like a bad dream as like a film he had videotaped
from the tv and now kept in the back of a cupboard without
bothering to watch.
One effect that still lingered though, was his joy at being back.
Now that the Earth's atmosphere had closed over his head for
good, he thought, wrongly, everything within it gave him
extraordinary pleasure. Looking at the silvery sparkle of the
raindrops he felt he had to protest.
"Well, I like them," he said suddenly, "and for all the obvious
reasons. They're light and refreshing. They sparkle and make you
feel good."
The man snorted derisively.
"That's what they all say," he said, and glowered darkly from his
corner seat.
He was a lorry driver. Arthur knew this because his opening,
unprovoked remark had been, "I'm a lorry driver. I hate driving
in the rain. Ironic isn't it? Bloody ironic."
If there was a sequitur hidden in this remark, Arthur had not
been able to divine it and had merely given a little grunt,
affable but not encouraging.
But the man had not been deterred then, and was not deterred now.
"They all say that about bloody April showers," he said. "So
bloody nice, so bloody refreshing, such charming bloody weather."
He leaned forward, screwing his face up as if he was going to say
something about the government.
"What I want to know is this," he said, "if it's going to be nice
weather, why," he almost spat, "can't it be nice without bloody
raining?"
Arthur gave up. He decided to leave his coffee, which was too hot
to drink quickly and too nasty to drink cold.
"Well, there you go," he said and instead got up himself. "Bye."
He stopped off at the service station shop, then walked back
through the car park, making a point of enjoying the fine play of
rain on his face. There was even, he noticed, a faint rainbow
glistening over the Devon hills. He enjoyed that too.
He climbed into his battered but adored old black Golf GTi,
squealed the tyres, and headed out past the islands of petrol
pumps and on to the slip road back towards the motorway.
He was wrong in thinking that the atmosphere of the Earth had
closed finally and for ever above his head.
He was wrong to think that it would ever be possible to put
behind him the tangled web of irresolutions into which his
galactic travels had dragged him.
He was wrong to think he could now forget that the big, hard,
oily, dirty, rainbow-hung Earth on which he lived was a
microscopic dot on a microscopic dot lost in the unimaginable
infinity of the Universe.
He drove on, humming, being wrong about all these things.
The reason he was wrong was standing by the slip road under a
small umbrella.
His jaw sagged. He sprained his ankle against the brake pedal and
skidded so hard he very nearly turned the car over.
"Fenny!" he shouted.
Having narrowly avoided hitting her with the actual car, he hit
her instead with the car door as he leant across and flung it
open at her.
It caught her hand and knocked away her umbrella, which then
bowled wildly away across the road.
"Shit!" yelled Arthur as helpfully as he cold, leapt out of his
own door, narrowly avoided being run down by McKeena's All-
Weather Haulage, and watched in horror as it ran down Fenny's
umbrella instead. The lorry swept along the motorway and away.
The umbrella lay like a recently swatted daddy-long-legs,
expiring sadly on the ground. Tiny gusts of wind made it twitch a
little.
He picked it up.
"Er," he said. There didn't seem to be a lot of point in offering
the thing back to her.
"How did you know my name?" she said.
"Er, well," he said. "Look, I'll get you another one ..."
He looked at her and tailed off.
She was tallish with dark hair which fell in waves around a pale
and serious face. Standing still, alone, she seemed almost
sombre, like a statue to some important but unpopular virtue in a
formal garden. She seemed to be looking at something other than
what she looked as if she was looking at.
But when she smiled, as she did now, it was as if she suddenly
arrived from somewhere. Warmth and life flooded into her face,
and impossibly graceful movement into her body. The effect was
very disconcerting, and it disconcerted Arthur like hell.
She grinned, tossed her bag into the back and swivelled herself
into the front seat.
"Don't worry about the umbrella," she said to him as she climbed
in. "It was my brother's and he can't have liked it or he
wouldn't have given it to me." She laughed and pulled on her
seatbelt. "You're not a friend of my brother's are you?"
"No."
Her voice was the only part of her which didn't say "Good".
Her physical presence there in the car, his car, was quite
extraordinary to Arthur. He felt, as he let the car pull slowly
away, that he could hardly think or breathe, and hoped that
neither of these functions were vital to his driving or they were
in trouble.
So what he had experienced in the other car, her brother's car,
the night he had returned exhausted and bewildered from his
nightmare years in the stars had not been the unbalance of the
moment, or, if it had been, he was at least twice as unbalanced
now, and quite liable to fall off whatever it is that well-
balanced people are supposed to be balancing on.
"So ..." he said, hoping to kick the conversation off to an
exciting start.
"He was meant to pick me up - my brother - but phoned to say he
couldn't make it. I asked about buses but the man started to look
at the calendar rather than a timetable, so I decided to hitch.
So."
"So."
"So here I am. And what I would like to know, is how you know my
name."
"Perhaps we ought to first sort out," said Arthur, looking back
over his shoulder as he eased his car into the motorway traffic,
"where I'm taking you."
Very close, he hoped, or long away. Close would mean she lived
near him, a long way would mean he could drive her there.
"I'd like to go to Taunton," she said, "please. If that's all
right. It's not far. You can drop me at ..."
"You live in Taunton?" he said, hoping that he'd managed to sound
merely curious rather than ecstatic. Taunton was wonderfully
close to him. He could ...
"No, London," she said. "There's a train in just under an hour."
It was the worst thing possible. Taunton was only minutes away up
the motorway. He wondered what to do, and while he was wondering
with horror heard himself saying, "Oh, I can take you to London.
Let me take you to London ..."
Bungling idiot. Why on Earth had he said "let" in that stupid
way? He was behaving like a twelve-year-old.
"Are you going to London?" she asked.
"I wasn't," he said, "but ..." Bungling idiot.
"It's very kind of you," she said, "but really no. I like to go
by train." And suddenly she was gone. Or rather, that part of her
which brought her to life was gone. She looked rather distantly
out of the window and hummed lightly to herself.
He couldn't believe it.
Thirty seconds into the conversation, and already he'd blown it.
Grown men, he told himself, in flat contradiction of centuries of
accumulated evidence about the way grown men behave, do not
behave like this.
Taunton miles, said the signpost.
He gripped the steering wheel so tightly the car wobbled. He was
going to have to do something dramatic.
"Fenny," he said.
She glanced round sharply at him.
"You still haven't told me how ..."
"Listen," said Arthur, "I will tell you, though the story is
rather strange. Very strange."
She was still looking at him, but said nothing.
"Listen ..."
"You said that."
"Did I? Oh. There are things I must talk to you about, and things
I must tell you ... a story I must tell you which would ..." He
was thrashing about. He wanted something along the lines of "Thy
knotted and combined locks to part, and each particular quill to
stand on end like quills upon the fretful porpentine" but didn't
think he could carry it off and didn't like the hedgehog
reference.
"... which would take more than five miles," he settled for in
the end, rather lamely he was afraid.
"Well ..."
"Just supposing," he said, "just supposing" - he didn't know what
was coming next, so he thought he'd just sit back and listen -
"that there was some extraordinary way in which you were very
important to me, and that, though you didn't know it, I was very
important to you, but it all went for nothing because we only had
five miles and I was a stupid idiot at knowing how to say
something very important to someone I've only just met and not
crash into lorries at the same time, what would you say ..." he
paused helplessly, and looked at her, "I ... should do?"
"Watch the road!" she yelped.
"Shit!"
He narrowly avoided careering into the side of a hundred Italian
washing machines in a German lorry.
"I think," she said, with a momentary sigh of relief, "you should
buy me a drink before my train goes."
There is, for some reason, something especially grim about pubs
near stations, a very particular kind of grubbiness, a special
kind of pallor to the pork pies.
Worse than the pork pies, though, are the sandwiches.
There is a feeling which persists in England that making a
sandwich interesting, attractive, or in any way pleasant to eat
is something sinful that only foreigners do.
"Make 'em dry," is the instruction buried somewhere in the
collective national consciousness, "make 'em rubbery. If you have
to keep the buggers fresh, do it by washing 'em once a week."
It is by eating sandwiches in pubs on Saturday lunchtimes that
the British seek to atone for whatever their national sins have
been. They're not altogether clear what those sins are, and don't
want to know either. Sins are not the sort of things one wants to
know about. But whatever their sins are they are amply atoned for
by the sandwiches they make themselves eat.
If there is anything worse than the sandwiches, it is the
sausages which sit next to them. Joyless tubes, full of gristle,
floating in a sea of something hot and sad, stuck with a plastic
pin in the shape of a chef's hat: a memorial, one feels, for some
chef who hated the world, and died, forgotten and alone among his
cats on a back stair in Stepney.
The sausages are for the ones who know what their sins are and
wish to atone for something specific.
"There must be somewhere better," said Arthur.
"No time," said Fenny, glancing at her watch. "My train leaves in
half an hour."
They sat at a small wobbly table. On it were some dirty glasses,
and some soggy beermats with jokes printed on them. Arthur got
Fenny a tomato juice, and himself a pint of yellow water with gas
in it. And a couple of sausages. He didn't know why. He bought
them for something to do while the gas settled in his glass.
The barman dunked Arthur's change in a pool of beer on the bar,
for which Arthur thanked him.
"All right," said Fenny, glancing at her watch, "tell me what it
is you have to tell me."
She sounded, as well she might, extremely sceptical, and Arthur's
heart sank. Hardly, he felt, the most conductive setting to try
to explain to her as she sat there, suddenly cool and defensive,
that in a sort of out-of-body dream he had had a telepathic sense
that the mental breakdown she had suffered had been connected
with the fact that, appearances to the contrary nonwithstanding,
the Earth had been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace
bypass, something which he alone on Earth knew anything about,
having virtually witnessed it from a Vogon spaceship, and that
furthermore both his body and soul ached for her unbearably and
he needed to got to bed with her as soon as was humanly possible.
"Fenny," he started.
"I wonder if you'd like to buy some tickets for our raffle? It's
just a little one."
He glanced up sharply.
"To raise money for Anjie who's retiring."
"What?"
"And needs a kidney machine."
He was being leant over by a rather stiffly slim middle-aged
woman with a prim knitted suit and a prim little perm, and a prim
little smile that probably got licked by prim little dogs a lot.
She was holding out a small book of cloakroom tickets and a
collecting tin.
"Only ten pence each," she said, "so you could probably even buy
two. Without breaking the bank!" She gave a tinkly little laugh
and then a curiously long sigh. Saying "Without breaking the
bank" had obviously given her more pleasure than anything since
some GIs had been billeted on her in the war.
"Er, yes, all right," said Arthur, hurriedly digging in his
pocket and producing a couple of coins.
With infuriating slowness, and prim theatricality, if there was
such a thing, the woman tore off two tickets and handed them to
Arthur.
"I do hope you win," she said with a smile that suddenly snapped
together like a piece of advanced origami, "the prizes are so
nice."
"Yes, thank you," said Arthur, pocketing the tickets rather
brusquely and glancing at his watch.
He turned towards Fenny.
So did the woman with the raffle tickets.
"And what about you, young lady?" she said. "It's for Anjie's
kidney machine. She's retiring you see. Yes?" She hoisted the
little smile even further up her face. She would have to stop and
let it go soon or the skin would surely split.
"Er, look, here you are," said Arthur, and pushed a fifty pence
piece at her in the hope that that would see her off.
"Oh, we are in the money, aren't we?" said the woman, with a long
smiling sigh. "Down from London are we?"
"No, that's all right, really," he said with a wave of his hand,
and she started with an awful deliberation to peel off five
tickets, one by one.
"Oh, but you must have your tickets," insisted the woman, "or you
won't be able to claim your prize. They're very nice prizes, you
know. Very suitable."
Arthur snatched the tickets, and said thank you as sharply as he
could.
The woman turned to Fenny once again.
"And now, what about ..."
"No!" Arthur nearly yelled. "These are for her," he explained,
brandishing the five new tickets.
"Oh, I see! How nice!"
She smiled sickeningly at both of them.
"Well, I do hope you ..."
"Yes," snapped Arthur, "thank you."
The woman finally departed to the table next to theirs. Arthur
turned desperately to Fenny, and was relieved to see that she was
rocking with silent laughter.
He sighed and smiled.
"Where were we?"
"You were calling me Fenny, and I was about to ask you not to."
"What do you mean?"
She twirled the little wooden cocktail stick in her tomato juice.
"It's why I asked if you were a friend of my brother's. Or half-
brother really. He's the only one who calls me Fenny, and I'm not
fond of him for it."
"So what's ...?"
"Fenchurch."
"What?"
"Fenchurch."
"Fenchurch."
She looked at him sternly.
"Yes," she said, "and I'm watching you like a lynx to see if
you're going to ask the same silly question that everybody asks
me until I want to scream. I shall be cross and disappointed if
you do. Plus I shall scream. So watch it."
She smiled, shook her hair a little forward over her face and
peered at him from behind it.
"Oh," he said, "that's a little unfair, isn't it?"
"Yes."
"Fine."
"All right," she said with a laugh, "you can ask me. Might as
well get it over with. Better than have you call me Fenny all the
time."
"Presumably ..." said Arthur.
"We've only got two tickets left, you see, and since you were so
generous when I spoke to you before ..."
"What?" snapped Arthur.
The woman with the perm and the smile and the now nearly empty
book of cloakroom tickets was now waving the two last ones under
his nose.
"I thought I'd give the opportunity to you, because the prizes
are so nice."
She wrinkled up he nose a little confidentially.
"Very tasteful. I know you'll like them. And it is for Anjie's
retirement present you see. We want to give her ..."
"A kidney machine, yes," said Arthur. "Here."
He held out two more ten pence pieces to her, and took the
tickets.
A thought seemed to strike the woman. It struck her very slowly.
You could watch it coming in like a long wave on a sandy beach.
"Oh dear," she said, "I'm not interrupting anything am I?"
She peered anxiously at both of them.
"No it's fine," said Arthur. Everything that could possibly be
fine," he insisted, "is fine.
"Thank you," he added.
"I say," she said, in a delightful ecstacy of worry, "you're not
... in love, are you?"
"It's very hard to say," said Arthur. "We haven't had a chance to
talk yet."
He glanced at Fenchurch. She was grinning.
The woman nodded with knowing confidentiality.
"I'll let you see the prizes in a minute," she said, and left.
Arthur turned, with a sigh, back to the girl that he found it
hard to say whether he was in love with.
"You were about to ask me," she said, "a question."
"Yes," said Arthur.
"We can do it together if you like," said Fenchurch. "Was I found
..."
"... in a handbag ..." joined in Arthur.
"... in the Left Luggage Office ..." they said together.
"... at Fenchurch street station," they finished.
"And the answer," said Fenchurch, "is no."
"Fine," said Arthur.
"I was conceived there."
"What?"
"I was con-"
"In the Left Luggage Office?" hooted Arthur.
"No, of course not. Don't be silly. What would my parents be
doing in the Left Luggage Office?" she said, rather taken aback
by the suggestion.
"Well, I don't know," spluttered Arthur, "or rather ..."
"It was in the ticket queue."
"The ..."
"The ticket queue. Or so they claim. They refuse to elaborate.
They only say you wouldn't believe how bored it is possible to
get in the ticket queue at Fenchurch Street Station."
She sipped demurely at her tomato juice and looked at her watch.
Arthur continued to gurgle for a moment or two.
"I'm going to have to go in a minute or two," said Fenchurch,
"and you haven't begun to tell me whatever this terrifically
extraordinary thing is that you were so keen to get off your
chest."
"Why don't you let me drive you to London?" said Arthur. "It's
Saturday, I've got nothing particular to do, I'd ..."
"No," said Fenchurch, "thank you, it's sweet of you, but no. I
need to be by myself for a couple of days." She smiled and
shrugged.
"But ..."
"You can tell me another time. I'll give you my number."
Arthur's heart went boom boom churn churn as she scribbled seven
figures in pencil on a scrap of paper and handed it to him.
"Now we can relax," she said with a slow smile which filled
Arthur till he thought he would burst.
"Fenchurch," he said, enjoying the name as he said it. "I -"
"A box," said a trailing voice, "of cherry liqueurs, and also,
and I know you'll like this, a gramophone record of Scottish
bagpipe music ..."
"Yes thank you, very nice," insisted Arthur.
"I just thought I'd let you have a look at them," said the permed
woman, "as you're down from London ..."
She was holding them out proudly for Arthur too see. He could see
that they were indeed a box of cherry brandy liqueurs and a
record of bagpipe music. That was what they were.
"I'll let you have your drink in peace now," she said, patting
Arthur lightly on his seething shoulder, "but I knew you'd like
to see."
Arthur re-engaged his eyes with Fenchurch's once again, and
suddenly was at a loss for something to say. A moment had come
and gone between the two of them, but the whole rhythm of it had
been wrecked by that stupid, blasted woman.
"Don't worry," said Fenchurch, looking at him steadily from over
the top of her glass, "we will talk again." She took a sip.
"Perhaps," she added, "it wouldn't have gone so well if it wasn't
for her." She gave a wry little smile and dropped her hair
forward over her face again.
It was perfectly true.
He had to admit it was perfectly true.
That night, at home, as he was prancing round the house
pretending to be tripping through cornfields in slow motion and
continually exploding with sudden laughter, Arthur thought he
could even bear to listen to the album of bagpipe music he had
won. It was eight o'clock and he decided he would make himself,
force himself, to listen to the whole record before he phoned
her. Maybe he should even leave it till tomorrow. That would be
the cool thing to do. Or next week sometime.
No. No games. He wanted her and didn't care who knew it. He
definitely and absolutely wanted her, adored her, longed for her,
wanted to do more things than there were names for with her.
He actually caught himself saying thinks like "Yippee" as he
prances ridiculously round the house. Her eyes, her hair, her
voice, everything ...
He stopped.
He would put on the record of bagpipe music. Then he would call
her.
Would he, perhaps, call her first?
No. What he would do was this. He would put on the record of
bagpipe music. He would listen to it, every last banshee wail of
it. Then he would call her. That was the correct order. That was
what he would do.
He was worried about touching things in case they blew up when he
did so.
He picked up the record. It failed to blow up. He slipped it out
of its cover. He opened the record player, he turned on the amp.
They both survived. He giggled foolishly as he lowered the stylus
on to the disc.
He sat and listened solemnly to "A Scottish Soldier".
He listened to "Amazing Grace".
He listened to something about some glen or other.
He thought about his miraculous lunchtime.
They had just been on the point of leaving, when they were
distracted by an awful outbreak of "yoo-hooing". The appallingly
permed woman was waving to them across the room like some stupid
bird with a broken wing. Everyone in the pub turned to them and
seemed to be expecting some sort of response.
They hadn't listened to the bit about how pleased and happy Anjie
was going to be about the .p everyone had helped to raise
towards the cost of her kidney machine, had been vaguely aware
that someone from the next table had won a box of cherry brandy
liqueurs, and took a moment or two to cotton on to the fact that
the yoo-hooing lady was trying to ask them if they had ticket
number .
Arthur discovered that he had. He glanced angrily at his watch.
Fenchurch gave him a push.
"Go on," she said, "go and get it. Don't be bad tempered. Give
them a nice speech about how pleased you are and you can give me
a call and tell me how it went. I'll want to hear the record. Go
on."
She flicked his arm and left.
The regulars thought his acceptance speech a little over-
effusive. It was, after all, merely an album of bagpipe music.
Arthur thought about it, and listened to the music, and kept on
breaking into laughter.
Ring ring.
Ring ring.
Ring ring.
"Hello, yes? Yes, that's right. Yes. You'll 'ave to speak up,
there's an awful lot of noise in 'ere. What?
"No, I only do the bar in the evenings. It's Yvonne who does
lunch, and Jim, he's the landlord. No, I wasn't on. What?
"You'll have to speak up.
"What? No, don't know anything about no raffle. What?
"No, don't know nothing about it. 'Old on, I'll call Jim."
The barmaid put her hand over the receiver and called over the
noisy bar.
"'Ere, Jim, bloke on the phone says something about he's won a
raffle. He keeps on saying it's ticket and he's won."
"No, there was a guy in the pub here won," shouted back the
barman.
"He says 'ave we got the ticket."
"Well how can he think he's won if he hasn't even got a ticket?"
"Jim says 'ow can you think you've won if you "aven't even got
the ticket. What?"
She put her hand over the receiver again.
"Jim, 'e keeps effing and blinding at me. Says there's a number
on the ticket."
"Course there was a number on the ticket, it was a bloody raffle
ticket wasn't it?"
"'E says 'e means its a telephone number on the ticket."
"Put the phone down and serve the bloody customers, will you?"
Eight hours West sat a man alone on a beach mourning an
inexplicable loss. He could only think of his loss in little
packets of grief at a time, because the whole thing was too great
to be borne.
He watched the long slow Pacific waves come in along the sand,
and waited and waited for the nothing that he knew was about to
happen. As the time came for it not to happen, it duly didn't
happen and so the afternoon wore itself away and the sun dropped
beneath the long line of sea, and the day was gone.
The beach was a beach we shall not name, because his private
house was there, but it was a small sandy stretch somewhere along
the hundreds of miles of coastline that first runs west from Los
Angeles, which is described in the new edition of the Hitch
Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy in one entry as "junky, wunky, lunky,
stunky, and what's that other word, and all kinds of bad stuff,
woo", and in another, written only hours later as "being like
several thousand square miles of American Express junk mail, but
without the same sense of moral depth. Plus the air is, for some
reason, yellow."
The coastline runs west, and then turns north up to the misty bay
of San Francisco, which the Guide describes as a "good place to
go. It's very easy to believe that everyone you meet there is
also a space traveller. Starting a new religion for you is just
their way of saying hi'. Until you've settled in and got the
hang of the place it is best to say no' to three questions out
of any given four that anyone may ask you, because there are some
very strange things going on there, some of which an unsuspecting
alien could die of." The hundreds of curling miles of cliffs and
sand, palm trees, breakers and sunsets are described in the Guide
as "Boffo. A good one."
And somewhere on this good boffo stretch of coastline lay the
house of this inconsolable man, a man whom many regarded as being
insane. But this was only, as he would tell people, because he
was.
One of the many many reasons why people thought him insane was
because of the peculiarity of his house which, even in a land
where most people's houses were peculiar in one way or another,
was quite extreme in his peculiarness.
His house was called The Outside of the Asylum.
His name was simply John Watson, though he preferred to be called
- and some of his friends had now reluctantly agreed to this -
Wonko the Sane.
In his house were a number of strange things, including a grey
glass bowl with eight words engraved upon it.
We can talk of him much later on - this is just an interlude to
watch the sun go down and to say that he was there watching it.
He had lost everything he cared for, and was now simply waiting
for the end of the world - little realizing that it had already
been and gone.
After a disgusting Sunday spent emptying rubbish bins behind a
pub in Taunton, and finding nothing, no raffle ticket, no
telephone number, Arthur tried everything he could to find
Fenchurch, and the more things he tried, the more weeks passed.
He raged and railed against himself, against fate, against the
world and its weather. He even, in his sorrow and his fury, went
and sat in the motorway service station cafeteria where he'd been
just before he met her.
"It's the drizzle that makes me particularly morose."
"Please shut up about the drizzle," snapped Arthur.
"I would shut up if it would shut up drizzling."
"Look ..."
"But I'll tell you what it will do when it shuts up drizzling,
shall I?"
"No."
"Blatter."
"What?"
"It will blatter."
Arthur stared over the rim of his coffee cup at the grisly
outside world. It was a completely pointless place to be, he
realized, and he had been driven there by superstition rather
than logic. However, as if to bait him with the knowledge that
such coincidences could in fact happen, fate had chosen to
reunite him with the lorry driver he had encountered there last
time.
The more he tried to ignore him, the more he found himself being
dragged back into the gravitic whirlpool of the man's
exasperating conversation.
"I think," said Arthur vaguely, cursing himself for even
bothering to say this, "that it's easing off."
"Ha!"
Arthur just shrugged. He should go. That's what he should do. He
should just go.
"It never stops raining!" ranted the lorry driver. He thumped the
table, spilt his tea, and actually, for a moment, appeared to be
steaming.
You can't just walk off without responding to a remark like that.
"Of course it stops raining," said Arthur. It was hardly an
elegant refutation, but it had to be said.
"It rains ... all ... the time," raved the man, thumping the
table again, in time to the words.
Arthur shook his head.
"Stupid to say it rains all the time ..." he said.
The man's eyebrows shot up, affronted.
"Stupid? Why's it stupid? Why's it stupid to say it rains all the
time if it rains the whole time?"
"Didn't rain yesterday."
"Did in Darlington."
Arthur paused, warily.
"You going to ask me where I was yesterday?" asked the man. "Eh?"
"No," said Arthur.
"But I expect you can guess."
"Do you."
"Begins with a D."
"Does it."
"And it was pissing down there, I can tell you."
"You don't want to sit there, mate," said a passing stranger in
overalls to Arthur cheerily. "That's Thundercloud Corner that is.
Reserved special for old Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head here.
There's one reserved in every motorway caff between here and
sunny Denmark. Steer clear is my advice. 'Swhat we all do. How's
it going, Rob? Keeping busy? Got your wet-weather tyres on? Har
har."
He breezed by and went to tell a joke about Britt Ekland to
someone at a nearby table.
"See, none of them bastards take me seriously," said Rob McKeena.
"But," he added darkly, leaning forward and screwing up his eyes,
"they all know it's true!"
Arthur frowned.
"Like my wife," hissed the sole owner and driver of McKeena's
All-Weather Haulage. "She says it's nonsense and I make a fuss
and complain about nothing, but," he paused dramatically and
darted out dangerous looks from his eyes, "she always brings the
washing in when I phone to say I'm on me way home!" He brandished
his coffee spoon. "What do you make of that?"
"Well ..."
"I have a book," he went on, "I have a book. A diary. Kept it for
fifteen years. Shows every single place I've ever been. Every
day. And also what the weather was like. And it was uniformly,"
he snarled, "'orrible. All over England, Scotland, Wales I been.
All round the Continent, Italy, Germany, back and forth to
Denmark, been to Yugoslavia. It's all marked in and charted. Even
when I went to visit my brother," he added, "in Seattle."
"Well," said Arthur, getting up to leave at last, "perhaps you'd
better show it to someone."
"I will," said Rob McKeena.
And he did.
Misery, dejection. More misery and more dejection. He needed a
project and he gave himself one.
He would find where his cave had been.
On prehistoric Earth he had lived in a cave, not a nice cave, a
lousy cave, but ... There was no but. It had been a totally lousy
cave and he had hated it. But he had lived in it for five years
which made it home of some kind, and a person likes to keep track
of his homes. Arthur Dent was such a person and so he went to
Exeter to buy a computer.
That was what he really wanted, of course, a computer. But he
felt he ought to have some serious purpose in mind before he
simply went and lashed out a lot of readies on what people might
otherwise mistake as being just a thing to play with. So that was
his serious purpose. To pinpoint the exact location of a cave on
prehistoric Earth. He explained this to the man in the shop.
"Why?" said the man in the shop.
This was a tricky one.
"OK, skip that," said the man in the shop. "How?"
"Well, I was hoping you could help me with that."
The man sighed and his shoulders dropped.
"Have you much experience of computers?"
Arthur wondered whether to mention Eddie the shipboard computer
on the Heart of Gold, who could have done the job in a second, or
Deep Thought, or - but decided he wouldn't.
"No," he said.
"Looks like a fun afternoon," said the man in the shop, but he
said it only to himself.
Arthur bought the Apple anyway. Over a few days he also acquired
some astronomical software, plotted the movements of stars, drew
rough little diagrams of how he seemed to remember the stars to
have been in the sky when he looked up out of his cave at night,
and worked away busily at it for weeks, cheerfully putting off
the conclusion he knew he would inevitably have to come to, which
was that the whole project was completely ludicrous.
Rough drawings from memory were futile. He didn't even know how
long it had been, beyond Ford Prefect's rough guess at the time
that it was "a couple of million years" and he simply didn't have
the maths.
Still, in the end he worked out a method which would at least
produce a result. He decided not to mind the fact that with the
extraordinary jumble of rules of thumb, wild approximations and
arcane guesswork he was using he would be lucky to hit the right
galaxy, he just went ahead and got a result.
He would call it the right result. Who would know?
As it happened, through the myriad and unfathomable chances of
fate, he got it exactly right, though he of course would never
know that. He just went up to London and knocked on the
appropriate door.
"Oh. I thought you were going to phone me first."
Arthur gaped in astonishment.
"You can only come in for a few minutes," said Fenchurch. "I'm
just going out."
A summer's day in Islington, full of the mournful wail of
antique-restoring machinery.
Fenchurch was unavoidably busy for the afternoon, so Arthur
wandered in a blissed-out haze and looked at all the shops which,
in Islington, are quite an useful bunch, as anyone who regularly
needs old woodworking tools, Boer War helmets, drag, office
furniture or fish will readily confirm.
The sun beat down over the roofgardens. It beat on architects and
plumbers. It beat on barristers and burglars. It beat on pizzas.
It beat on estate agent's particulars.
It beat on Arthur as he went into a restored furniture shop.
"It's an interesting building," said the proprietor, cheerfully.
"There's a cellar with a secret passage which connects with a
nearby pub. It was built for the Prince Regent apparently, so he
could make his escape when he needed to."
"You mean, in case anybody might catch him buying stripped pine
furniture," said Arthur
"No," said the proprietor, "not for that reason."
"You'll have to excuse me," said Arthur. "I'm terribly happy."
"I see."
He wandered hazily on and found himself outside the offices of
Greenpeace. he remembered the contents of his file marked "Things
to do - urgent!", which he hadn't opened again in the meantime.
He marched in with a cheery smile and said he'd come to give them
some money to help free the dolphins.
"Very funny," they told him, "go away."
This wasn't quite the response he had expected, so he tried
again. This time they got quite angry with him, so he just left
some money anyway and went back out into the sunshine.
Just after six he returned to Fenchurch's house in the alleyway,
clutching a bottle of champagne.
"Hold this," she said, shoved a stout rope in his hand and
disappeared inside through the large white wooden doors from
which dangled a fat padlock off a black iron bar.
The house was a small converted stable in a light industrial
alleyway behind the derelict Royal Agricultural Hall of
Islington. As well as its large stable doors it also had a
normal-looking front door of smartly glazed panelled wood with a
black dolphin door knocker. The one odd thing about this door was
its doorstep, which was nine feet high, since the door was set
into the upper of the two floors and presumably had been
originally used to haul in hay for hungry horses.
An old pulley jutted out of the brickwork above the doorway and
it was over this that the rope Arthur was holding was slung. The
other end of the rope held a suspended 'cello.
The door opened above his head.
"OK," said Fenchurch, "pull on the rope, steady the 'cello. Pass
it up to me."
He pulled on the rope, he steadied the 'cello.
"I can't pull on the rope again," he said, "without letting go of
the 'cello."
Fenchurch leant down.
"I'm steadying the 'cello," she said. "You pull on the rope."
The 'cello eased up level with the doorway, swinging slightly,
and Fenchurch manoeuvred it inside.
"Come on up yourself," she called down.
Arthur picked up his bag of goodies and went in through the
stable doors, tingling.
The bottom room, which he had seen briefly before, was pretty
rough and full of junk. A large old cast-iron mangle stood there,
a surprising number of kitchen sinks were piled in a corner.
There was also, Arthur was momentarily alarmed to see, a pram,
but it was very old and uncomplicatedly full of books.
The floor was old stained concrete, excitingly cracked. And this
was the measure of Arthur's mood as he stared up the rickety
wooden steps in the far corner. Even a cracked concrete floor
seemed to him an almost unbearably sensual thing.
"An architect friend of mine keeps on telling me how he can do
wonderful things with this place," said Fenchurch chattily as
Arthur emerged through the floor. "He keeps on coming round,
standing in stunned amazement muttering about space and objects
and events and marvellous qualities of light, then says he needs
a pencil and disappears for weeks. Wonderful things have,
therefore, so far failed to happen to it."
In fact, thought Arthur as he looked about, the upper room was at
least reasonably wonderful anyway. It was simply decorated,
furnished with things made out of cushions and also a stereo set
with speakers which would have impressed the guys who put up
Stonehenge.
There were flowers which were pale and pictures which were
interesting.
There was a sort of gallery structure in the roof space which
held a bed and also a bathroom which, Fenchurch explained, you
could actually swing a cat in. "But," she added, "only if it was
a reasonably patient cat and didn't mind a few nasty cracks about
the head. So. here you are."
"Yes."
They looked at each other for a moment.
The moment became a longer moment, and suddenly it was a very
long moment, so long one could hardly tell where all the time was
coming from.
For Arthur, who could usually contrive to feel self-conscious if
left alone for long enough with a Swiss Cheese plant, the moment
was one of sustained revelation. He felt on the sudden like a
cramped and zoo-born animal who awakes one morning to find the
door to his cage hanging quietly open and the savannah stretching
grey and pink to the distant rising sun, while all around new
sounds are waking.
He wondered what the new sounds were as he gazed at her openly
wondering face and her eyes that smiled with a shared surprise.
He hadn't realized that life speaks with a voice to you, a voice
that brings you answers to the questions you continually ask of
it, had never consciously detected it or recognized its tones
till it now said something it had never said to him before, which
was "Yes".
Fenchurch dropped her eyes away at last, with a tiny shake of her
head.
"I know," she said. "I shall have to remember," she added, "that
you are the sort of person who cannot hold on to a simple piece
of paper for two minutes without winning a raffle with it."
She turned away.
"Let's go for a walk," she said quickly. "Hyde Park. I'll change
into something less suitable."
She was dressed in a rather severe dark dress, not a particularly
shapely one, and it didn't really suit her.
"I wear it specially for my 'cello teacher," she said. "He's a
nice boy, but I sometimes think all that bowing gets him a bit
excited. I'll be down in a moment."
She ran lightly up the steps to the gallery above, and called
down, "Put the bottle in the fridge for later."
He noticed as he slipped the champagne bottle into the door that
it had an identical twin to sit next to.
He walked over to the window and looked out. He turned and
started to look at her records. From above he heard the rustle of
her dress fall to the ground. He talked to himself about the sort
of person he was. He told himself very firmly that for this
moment at least he would keep his eyes very firmly and
steadfastly locked on to the spines of her records, read the
titles, nod appreciatively, count the blasted things if he had
to. He would keep his head down.
This he completely, utterly and abjectly failed to do.
She was staring down at him with such intensity that she seemed
hardly to notice that he was looking up at her. Then suddenly she
shook her head, dropped the light sundress over herself and
disappeared quickly into the bathroom.
She emerged a moment later, all smiles and with a sunhat and came
tripping down the steps with extraordinary lightness. It was a
strange kind of dancing motion she had. She saw that he noticed
it and put her head slightly on one side.
"Like it?" she said.
"You look gorgeous," he said simply, because she did.
"Hmmmm," she said, as if he hadn't really answered her question.
She closed the upstairs front door which had stood open all this
time, and looked around the little room to see that it was all in
a fit state to be left on its own for a while. Arthur's eyes
followed hers around, and while he was looking in the other
direction she slipped something out of a drawer and into the
canvas bag she was carrying.
Arthur looked back at her.
"Ready?"
"Did you know," she said with a slightly puzzled smile, "that
there's something wrong with me?"
Her directness caught Arthur unprepared.
"Well," he said, "I'd heard some vague sort of ..."
"I wonder how much you do know about me," she said. "I you heard
it from where I think you heard then that's not it. Russell just
sort of makes stuff up, because he can't deal with what it really
is."
A pang of worry went through Arthur.
"Then what is it?" he said. "Can you tell me?"
"Don't worry," she said, "it's nothing bad at all. Just unusual.
Very very unusual."
She touched his hand, and then leant forward and kissed him
briefly.
"I shall be very interested to know," she said, "if you manage to
work out what it is this evening."
Arthur felt that if someone tapped him at that point he would
have chimed, like the deep sustained rolling chime his grey
fishbowl made when he flicked it with his thumbnail.
Ford Prefect was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound
of gunfire.
He slid himself out of the maintenance hatchway which he had
fashioned into a bunk for himself by disabling some of the
noisier machinery in his vicinity and padding it with towels. He
slung himself down the access ladder and prowled the corridors
moodily.
They were claustrophobic and ill-lit, and what light there was
was continually flickering and dimming as power surged this way
and that through the ship, causing heavy vibrations and rasping
humming noises.
That wasn't it, though.
He paused and leaned back against the wall as something that
looked like a small silver power drill flew past him down the dim
corridor with a nasty searing screech.
That wasn't it either.
He clambered listlessly through a bulkhead door and found himself
in a larger corridor, though still ill-lit.
The ship lurched. It had been doing this a fair bit, but this was
heavier. A small platoon of robots weent by making a terrible
clattering.
Still not it, though.
Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end of the corridor, so he
walked along it in the other direction.
He passed a series of observation monitors let into the walls
behind plates of toughened but still badly scratched perspex.
One of them showed some horrible green scaly reptilian figure
ranting and raving about the Single Transferable Vote system. It
was hard to tell whether he was for or against it, but he clearly
felt very strongly about it. Ford turned the sound down.
That wasn't it, though.
He passed another monitor. It was showing a commercial for some
brand of toothpaste that would apparently make you feel free if
you used it. There was nasty blaring music with it too, but that
wasn't it.
He came upon another, much larger three-dimensional screen that
was monitoring the outside of the vast silver Xaxisian ship.
As he watched, a thousand horribly beweaponed Zirzla robot
starcruisers came searing round the dark shadow of a moon,
silhouetted against the blinding disc of the star Xaxis, and the
ship simultaneously unleashed a vicious blaze of hideously
incomprehensible forces from all its orifices against them.
That was it.
Ford shook his head irritably and rubbed his eyes. He slumped on
the wrecked body of a dull silver robot which clearly had been
burning earlier on, but had now cooled down enough to sit on.
He yawned and dug his copy of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the
Galaxy out of his satchel. He activated the screen, and flicked
idly through some level three entries and some level four
entries. He was looking for some good insomnia cures. He found
Rest, which was what he reckoned he needed. He found Rest and
Recuperation and was about to pass on when he suddenly had a
better idea. He looked up at the monitor screen. The battle was
raging more fiercely every second and the noise was appalling.
The ship juddered, screamed, and lurched as each new bolt of
stunning energy was delivered or received.
He looked back down at the Guide again and flipped through a few
likely locations. He suddenly laughed, and then rummaged in his
satchel again.
He pulled out a small memory dump module, wiped off the fluff and
biscuit crumbs, and plugged it into an interface on the back of
the Guide.
When all the information that he could think was relevant had
been dumped into the module, he unplugged it again, tossed it
lightly in the palm of his hand, put the Guide away in his
satchel, smirked, and went in search of the ship's computer data
banks.
"The purpose of having the sun go low in the evenings, in the
summer, especially in parks," said the voice earnestly, "is to
make girl's breasts bob up and down more clearly to the eye. I am
convinced that this is the case."
Arthur and Fenchurch giggled about this to each other as they
passed. She hugged him more tightly for a moment.
"And I am certain," said the frizzy ginger-haired youth with the
long thin nose who was epostulating from his deckchair by the
side of the Serpentine, "that if one worked the argument through,
one would find that it flowed with perfect naturalness and logic
from everything," he insisted to his thin dark-haired companion
who was slumped in the next door deckchair feeling dejected about
his spots, "that Darwin was going on about. This is certain. This
is indisputable. And," he added, "I love it."
He turned sharply and squinted through his spectacles at
Fenchurch. Arthur steered her away and could feel her silently
quaking.
"Next guess," she said, when she had stopped giggling, "come on."
"All right," he said, "your elbow. Your left elbow. There's
something wrong with your left elbow."
"Wrong again," she said, "completely wrong. You're on completely
the wrong track."
The summer sun was sinking through the tress in the park, looking
as if - Let's not mince words. Hyde Park is stunning. Everything
about it is stunning except for the rubbish on Monday mornings.
Even the ducks are stunning. Anyone who can go through Hyde Park
on a summer's evening and not feel moved by it is probably going
through in an ambulance with the sheet pulled over their face.
It is a park in which people do more extraordinary things than
they do elsewhere. Arthur and Fenchurch found a man in shorts
practising the bagpipes to himself under a tree. The piper paused
to chase off an American couple who had tried, timidly to put
some coins on the box his bagpipes came in.
"No!" he shouted at them, "go away! I'm only practising."
He started resolutely to reinflate his bag, but even the noise
this made could not disfigure their mood.
Arthur put his arms around her and moved them slowly downwards.
"I don't think it can be your bottom," he said after a while,"
there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with that at all."
"Yes," she agreed, "there's absolutely nothing wrong with my
bottom."
They kissed for so long that eventually the piper went and
practised on the other side of the tree.
"I'll tell you a story," said Arthur.
"Good."
They found a patch of grass which was relatively free of couples
actually lying on top of each other and sat and watched the
stunning ducks and the low sunlight rippling on the water which
ran beneath the stunning ducks.
"A story," said Fenchurch, cuddling his arm to her.
"Which will tell you something of the sort of things that happen
to me. It's absolutely true."
"You know sometimes people tell you stories that are supposed to
be something that happened to their wife's cousin's best friend,
but actually probably got made up somewhere along the line."
"Well, it's like one of those stories, except that it actually
happened, and I know it actually happened, because the person it
actually happened to was me."
"Like the raffle ticket."
Arthur laughed. "Yes. I had a train to catch," he went on. "I
arrived at the station ..."
"Did I ever tell you," interrupted Fenchurch, "what happened to
my parents in a station?"
"Yes," said Arthur, "you did."
"Just checking."
Arthur glanced at his watch. "I suppose we could think of getting
back," he said.
"Tell me the story," said Fenchurch firmly. "You arrived at the
station."
"I was about twenty minutes early. I'd got the time of the train
wrong. I suppose it is at least equally possible," he added after
a moment's reflection, "that British Rail had got the time of the
train wrong. Hadn't occurred to me before."
"Get on with it." Fenchurch laughed.
"So I bought a newspaper, to do the crossword, and went to the
buffet to get a cup of coffee."
"You do the crossword?"
"Yes."
"Which one?"
"The Guardian usually."
"I think it tries to be too cute. I prefer the Times. Did you
solve it?"
"What?"
"The crossword in the Guardian."
"I haven't had a chance to look at it yet," said Arthur, "I'm
still trying to buy the coffee."
"All right then. Buy the coffee."
"I'm buying it. I am also," said Arthur, "buying some biscuits."
"What sort?"
"Rich Tea."
"Good choice."
"I like them. Laden with all these new possessions, I go and sit
at a table. And don't ask me what the table was like because this
was some time ago and I can't remember. It was probably round."
"All right."
"So let me give you the layout. Me sitting at the table. On my
left, the newspaper. On my right, the cup of coffee. In the
middle of the table, the packet of biscuits."
"I see it perfectly."
"What you don't see," said Arthur, "because I haven't mentioned
him yet, is the guy sitting at the table already. He is sitting
there opposite me."
"What's he like?"
"Perfectly ordinary. Briefcase. Business suit. He didn't look,"
said Arthur, "as if he was about to do anything weird."
"Ah. I know the type. What did he do?"
"He did this. He leaned across the table, picked up the packet of
biscuits, tore it open, took one out, and ..."
"What?"
"Ate it."
"What?"
"He ate it."
Fenchurch looked at him in astonishment. "What on Earth did you
do?"
"Well, in the circumstances I did what any red-blooded Englishman
would do. I was compelled," said Arthur, "to ignore it."
"What? Why?"
"Well, it's not the sort of thing you're trained for is it? I
searched my soul, and discovered that there was nothing anywhere
in my upbringing, experience or even primal instincts to tell me
how to react to someone who has quite simply, calmly, sitting
right there in front of me, stolen one of my biscuits."
"Well, you could ..." Fenchurch thought about it. "I must say I'm
not sure what I would have done either. So what happened?"
"I stared furiously at the crossword," said Arthur. "Couldn't do
a single clue, took a sip of coffee, it was too hot to drink, so
there was nothing for it. I braced myself. I took a biscuit,
trying very hard not to notice," he added, "that the packet was
already mysteriously open ..."
"But you're fighting back, taking a tough line."
"After my fashion, yes. I ate the biscuit. I ate it very
deliberately and visibly, so that he would have no doubt as to
what it was I was doing. When I eat a biscuit," Arthur said, "it
stays eaten."
"So what did he do?"
"Took another one. Honestly," insisted Arthur, "this is exactly
what happened. He took another biscuit, he ate it. Clear as
daylight. Certain as we are sitting on the ground."
Fenchurch stirred uncomfortably.
"And the problem was," said Arthur, "that having not said
anything the first time, it was somehow even more difficult to
broach the subject the second time around. What do you say?
Excuse me ... I couldn't help noticing, er ...' Doesn't work.
No, I ignored it with, if anything, even more vigour than
previously."
"My man ..."
"Stared at the crossword, again, still couldn't budge a bit of
it, so showing some of the spirit that Henry V did on St
Crispin's Day ..."
"What?"
"I went into the breach again. I took," said Arthur, "another
biscuit. And for an instant our eyes met."
"Like this?"
"Yes, well, no, not quite like that. But they met. Just for an
instant. And we both looked away. But I am here to tell you,"
said Arthur, "that there was a little electricity in the air.
There was a little tension building up over the table. At about
this time."
"I can imagine."
"We went through the whole packet like this. Him, me, him, me
..."
"The whole packet?"
"Well it was only eight biscuits but it seemed like a lifetime of
biscuits we were getting through at this point. Gladiators could
hardly have had a tougher time."
"Gladiators," said Fenchurch, "would have had to do it in the
sun. More physically gruelling."
"There is that. So. When the empty packet was lying dead between
us the man at last got up, having done his worst, and left. I
heaved a sigh of relief, of course. As it happened, my train was
announced a moment or two later, so I finished my coffee, stood
up, picked up the newspaper, and underneath the newspaper ..."
"Yes?"
"Were my biscuits."
"What?" said Fenchurch. "What?"
"True."
"No!" She gasped and tossed herself back on the grass laughing.
She sat up again.
"You completely nitwit," she hooted, "you almost completely and
utterly foolish person."
She pushed him backwards, rolled over him, kissed him and rolled
off again. He was surprised at how light she was.
"Now you tell me a story."
"I thought," she said putting on a low husky voice, "that you
were very keen to get back."
"No hurry," he said airily, "I want you to tell me a story."
She looked out over the kale and pondered.
"All right," she said, "it's only a short one. And not funny like
yours, but ... Anyway."
She looked down. Arthur could feel that it was one of those sorts
of moments. The air seemed to stand still around them, waiting.
Arthur wished that the air would go away and mind its own
business.
"When I was a kid," she said. "These sort of stories always start
like this, don't they, When I was a kid ...' Anyway. This is the
bit where the girl suddenly says, When I was a kid' and starts
to unburden herself. We have got to that bit. When I was a kid I
had this picture hanging over the foot of my bed ... What do you
think of it so far?"
"I like it. I think it's moving well. You're getting the bedroom
interest in nice and early. We could probably do with some
development with the picture."
"It was one of those pictures that children are supposed to
like," she said, "but don't. Full of endearing little animals
doing endearing things, you know?"
"I know. I was plagued with them too. Rabbits in waistcoats."
"Exactly. These rabbits were in fact on a raft, as were assorted
rats and owls. There may even have been a reindeer."
"On the raft."
"On the raft. And a boy was sitting on the raft."
"Among the rabbits in waistcoats and the owls and the reindeer."
"Precisely there. A boy of the cheery gypsy ragamuffin variety."
"Ugh."
"The picture worried me, I must say. There was an otter swimming
in front of the raft, and I used to lie awake at night worrying
about this otter having to pull the raft, with all these wretched
animals on it who shouldn't even be on a raft, and the otter had
such a thin tail to pull it with I thought it must hurt pulling
it all the time. Worried me. Not badly, but just vaguely, all the
time.
"Then one day - and remember I'd been looking at this picture
every night for years - I suddenly noticed that the raft had a
sail. Never seen it before. The otter was fine, he was just
swimming along."
She shrugged.
"Good story?" she said.
"Ends weakly," said Arthur, "leaves the audience crying Yes, but
what of it?' Fine up till there, but needs a final sting before
the credits."
Fenchurch laughed and hugged her legs.
"It was just such a sudden revelation, years of almost unnoticed
worry just dropping away, like taking off heavy weights, like
black and white becoming colour, like a dry stick suddenly being
watered. The sudden shift of perspective that says Put away your
worries, the world is a good and perfect place. It is in fact
very easy.' You probably thing I'm saying that because I'm going
to say that I felt like that this afternoon or something, don't
you?"
"Well, I ..." said Arthur, his composure suddenly shattered.
"Well, it's all right," she said, "I did. That's exactly what I
felt. But you see, I've felt that before, even stronger.
Incredibly strongly. I'm afraid I'm a bit of a one," she said
gazing off into the distance, "for sudden startling revelations."
Arthur was at sea, could hardly speak, and felt it wiser,
therefore, for the moment not to try.
"It was very odd," she said, much as one of the pursuing
Egyptians might have said that the behaviour of the Red Sea when
Moses waved his rod at it was a little on the strange side.
"Very odd," she repeated, "for days before, the strangest feeling
had been building in me, as if I was going to give birth. No, it
wasn't like that in fact, it was more as if I was being connected
into something, bit by bit. No, not even that; it was as if the
whole of the Earth, through me, was going to ..."
"Does the number," said Arthur gently, "forty-two mean anything
to you at all?"
"What? No, what are you talking about?" exclaimed Fenchurch.
"Just a thought," murmured Arthur.
"Arthur, I mean this, this is very real to me, this is serious."
"I was being perfectly serious," said Arthur. "It's just the
Universe I'm never quite sure about."
"What do you mean by that?"
"Tell me the rest of it," he said. "Don't worry if it sounds odd.
Believe me, you are talking to someone who has seen a lot of
stuff," he added, "that is odd. And I don't mean biscuits."
She nodded, and seemed to believe him. Suddenly, she gripped his
arm.
"It was so simple," she said, "so wonderfully and extraordinarily
simple, when it came."
"What was it?" said Arthur quietly.
"Arthur, you see," she said, "that's what I no longer know. And
the loss is unbearable. If I try to think back to it, it all goes
flickery and jumpy, and if I try too hard, I get as far as the
teacup and I just black out."
"What?"
"Well, like your story," she said, "the best bit happened in a
cafe. I was sitting there, having a cup of tea. This was after
days of this build up, the feeling of becoming connected up. I
think I was buzzing gently. And there was some work going on at a
building site opposite the cafe, and I was watching it through
the window, over the rim of my teacup, which I always find is the
nicest way of watching other people working. And suddenly, there
it was in my mind, this message from somewhere. And it was so
simple. It made such sense of everything. I just sat up and
thought, Oh! Oh, well that's all right then.' I was so startled
I almost dropped my teacup, in fact I think I did drop it. Yes,"
she added thoughtfully, "I'm sure I did. How much sense am I
making?"
"It was fine up to the bit about the teacup."
She shook her head, and shook it again, as if trying to clear it,
which is what she was trying to do.
"Well that's it," she said. "Fine up to the bit about the teacup.
That was the point at which it seemed to me quite literally as if
the world exploded."
"What ...?"
"I know it sounds crazy, and everybody says it was
hallucinations, but if that was hallucinations then I have
hallucinations in big screen D with -track Dolby Stereo and
should probably hire myself out to people who are bored with
shark movies. It was as if the ground was literally ripped from
under my feet, and ... and ..."
She patted the grass lightly, as if for reassurance, and then
seemed to change her mind about what she was going to say.
"And I woke up in hospital. I suppose I've been in and out ever
since. And that's why I have an instinctive nervousness," she
said, "of sudden startling revelations that's everything's going
to be all right." She looked up at him.
Arthur had simply ceased to worry himself about the strange
anomalies surrounding his return to his home world, or rather had
consigned them to that part of his mind marked "Things to think
about - Urgent." "Here is the world," he had told himself. "Here,
for whatever reason, is the world, and here it stays. With me on
it." But now it seemed to go swimmy around him, as it had that
night in the car when Fenchurch's brother had told him the silly
stories about the CIA agent in the reservoir. The trees went
swimmy. The lake went swimmy, but this was perfectly natural and
nothing to be alarmed by because a grey goose had just landed on
it. The geese were having a great relaxed time and had no major
answers they wished to know the questions to.
"Anyway," said Fenchurch, suddenly and brightly and with a wide-
eyed smile, "there is something wrong with part of me, and you've
got to find out what it is. We'll go home."
Arthur shook his head.
"What's the matter?" she said.
Arthur had shaken his head, not to disagree with her suggestion
which he thought was a truly excellent one, one of the world's
great suggestions, but because he was just for a moment trying to
free himself of the recurring impression he had that just when he
was least expecting it the Universe would suddenly leap out from
behind a door and go boo at him.
"I'm just trying to get this entirely clear in my mind," said
Arthur, "you say you felt as if the Earth actually ... exploded
..."
"Yes. More than felt."
"Which is what everybody else says," he said hesitantly, "is
hallucinations?"
"Yes, but Arthur that's ridiculous. People think that if you just
say hallucinations' it explains anything you want it to explain
and eventually whatever it is you can't understand will just go
away. It's just a word, it doesn't explain anything. It doesn't
explain why the dolphins disappeared."
"No," said Arthur. "No," he added thoughtfully. "No," he added
again, even more thoughtfully. "What?" he said at last.
"Doesn't explain the dolphins disappearing."
"No," said Arthur, "I see that. Which dolphins do you mean?"
"What do you mean which dolphins? I'm talking about when all the
dolphins disappeared."
She put her hand on his knee, which made him realize that the
tingling going up and down his spine was not her gently stroking
his back, and must instead be one of the nasty creepy feelings he
so often got when people were trying to explain things to him.
"The dolphins?"
"Yes."
"All the dolphins," said Arthur, "disappeared?"
"Yes."
"The dolphins? You're saying the dolphins all disappeared? Is
this," said Arthur, trying to be absolutely clear on this point,
"what you're saying?"
"Arthur where have you been for heaven's sake? The dolphins all
disappeared on the same day I ..."
She stared him intently in his startled eyes.
"What ...?"
"No dolphins. All gone. Vanished."
She searched his face.
"Did you really not know that?"
It was clear from his startled expression that he did not.
"Where did they go?" he asked.
"No one knows. That's what vanished means." She paused. "Well,
there is one man who says he knows about it, but everyone says he
lives in California," she said, "and is mad. I was thinking of
going to see him because it seems the only lead I've got on what
happened to me."
She shrugged, and then looked at him long and quietly. She lay
her hand on the side of his face.
"I really would like to know where you've been," she said. "I
think something terrible happened to you then as well. And that's
why we recognized each other."
She glanced around the park, which was now being gathered into
the clutches of dusk.
"Well," she said, "now you've got someone you can tell."
Arthur slowly let out a long year of a sigh.
"It is," he said, "a very long story."
Fenchurch leaned across him and drew over her canvas bag.
"Is it anything to do with this?" she said. The thing she took
out of her bag was battered and travelworn as it had been hurled
into prehistoric rivers, baked under the sun that shines so redly
on the deserts of Kakrafoon, half-buried in the marbled sands
that fringe the heady vapoured oceans of Santraginus V, frozen on
the glaciers of the moon of Jaglan Beta, sat on, kicked around
spaceships, scuffed and generally abused, and since its makers
had thought that these were exactly the sorts of things that
might happen to it, they had thoughtfully encased it in a sturdy
plastic cover and written on it, in large friendly letters, the
words "Don't Panic".
"Where did you get this?" said Arthur, startled, taking it from
her.
"Ah," she said, "I thought it was yours. In Russell's car that
night. You dropped it. Have you been to many of these places?"
Arthur drew the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy from its cover.
It was like a small, thin, flexible lap computer. He tapped some
buttons till the screen flared with text.
"A few," he said.
"Can we go to them?"
"What? No," said Arthur abruptly, then relented, but relented
warily. "Do you want to?" he said, hoping for the answer no. It
was an act of great generosity on his part not to say, "You don't
want to, do you?" which expects it.
"Yes," she said. "I want to know what the message was that I
lost, and where it came from. Because I don't think," she added,
standing up and looking round the increasing gloom of the park,
"that it came from here."
"I'm not even sure," she further added, slipping her arm around
Arthur's waist, "that I know where here is."
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is, as has been remarked
before often and accurately, a pretty startling kind of a thing.
It is, essentially, as the title implies, a guide book. The
problem is, or rather one of the problems, for there are many, a
sizeable portion of which are continually clogging up the civil,
commercial and criminal courts in all areas of the Galaxy, and
especially, where possible, the more corrupt ones, this.
The previous sentence makes sense. That is not the problem.
This is:
Change.
Read it through again and you'll get it.
The Galaxy is a rapidly changing place. There is, frankly, so
much of it, every bit of which is continually on the move,
continually changing. A bit of a nightmare, you might think, for
a scrupulous and conscientious editor diligently striving to keep
this massively detailed and complex electronic tome abreast of
all the changing circumstances and conditions that the Galaxy
throws up every minute of every hour of every day, and you would
be wrong. Where you would be wrong would be in failing to realize
that the editor, like all the editors of the Guide has ever had,
has no real grasp of the meanings of the words "scrupulous",
"conscientious" or "diligent", and tends to get his nightmares
through a straw.
Entries tend to get updated or not across the Sub-Etha Net
according to if they read good.
Take for example, the case of Brequinda on the Foth of Avalars,
famed in myth, legend and stultifyingly dull tri-d mini-serieses
as home of the magnificent and magical Fuolornis Fire Dragon.
In Ancient days, when Fragilis sang and Saxaquine of the Quenelux
held sway, when the air was sweet and the nights fragrant, but
everyone somehow managed to be, or so they claimed, though how on
earth they could have thought that anyone was even remotely
likely to believe such a preposterous claim what with all the
sweet air and fragrant nights and whatnot is anyone's guess,
virgins, it was not possible to heave a brick on Brequinda in the
Foth of Avalars without hitting at least half a dozen Fuolornis
Fire Dragons.
Whether you would want to do that is another matter.
Not that Fire Dragons weren't an essentially peace-loving
species, because they were. They adored it to bits, and this
wholesale adoring of things to bits was often in itself the
problem: one so often hurts the one one loves, especially if one
is a Fuolornis Fire Dragon with breath like a rocket booster and
teeth like a park fence. Another problem was that once they were
in the mood they often went on to hurt quite a lot of the ones
that other people loved as well. Add to all that the relatively
small number of madmen who actually went around the place heaving
bricks, and you end up with a lot of people on Brequinda in the
Foth of Avalars getting seriously hurt by dragons.
But did they mind? They did not.
Were they heard to bemoan their fate? No.
The Fuolornis Fire Dragons were revered throughout the lands of
Brequinda in the Foth of valors for their savage beauty, their
noble ways and their habit of biting people who didn't revere
them.
Why was this?
The answer was simple.
Sex.
There is, for some unfathomed reason, something almost unbearably
sexy about having huge fire-breathing magical dragons flying low
about the sky on moonlit nights which were already dangerously on
the sweet and fragrant side.
Why this should be so, the romance-besotted people of Brequinda
in the Foth of Avalars could not have told you, and would not
have stopped to discuss the matter once the effect was up and
going, for no sooner would a flock of half a dozen silk-winged
leather-bodied Fuolornis Fire Dragons heave into sight across the
evening horizon than half the people of Brequinda are scurrying
off into the woods with the other half, there to spend a busy
breathless night together and emerge with the first rays of dawn
all smiling and happy and still claiming, rather endearingly, to
be virgins, if rather flushed and sticky virgins.
Pheromones, some researchers said.
Something sonic, others claimed.
The place was always stiff with researchers trying to get to the
bottom of it all and taking a very long time about it.
Not surprisingly, the Guide's graphically enticing description of
the general state of affairs on this planet has proved to be
astonishingly popular amongst hitch-hikers who allow themselves
to be guided by it, and so it has simply never been taken out,
and it is therefore left to latter-day travellers to find out for
themselves that today's modern Brequinda in the City State of
Avalars is now little more than concrete, strip joints and Dragon
Burger Bars.
The night in Islington was sweet and fragrant.
There were, of course, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons about in the
alley, but if any had chanced by they might just as well have
sloped off across the road for a pizza, for they were not going
to be needed.
Had an emergency cropped up while they were still in the middle
of their American Hots with extra anchovy they could always have
sent across a message to put Dire Straits on the stereo, which is
now known to have much the same effect.
"No," said Fenchurch, "not yet."
Arthur put Dire Straits on the stereo. Fenchurch pushed ajar the
upstairs front door to let in a little more of the sweet fragrant
night air. They both sat on some of the furniture made out of
cushions, very close to the open bottle of champagne.
"No," said Fenchurch, "not till you've found out what's wrong
with me, which bit. But I suppose," she added very, very, very
quietly, "that we may as well start with where your hand is now."
Arthur said, "So which way do I go?"
"Down," said Fenchurch, "on this occasion."
He moved his hand.
"Down," she said, "is in fact the other way."
"Oh yes."
Mark Knopfler has an extraordinary ability to make a Schecter
Custom Stratocaster hoot and sing like angels on a Saturday
night, exhausted from being good all week and needing a stiff
beer - which is not strictly relevant at this point since the
record hadn't yet got to that bit, but there will be too much
else going on when it does, and furthermore the chronicler does
not intend to sit here with a track list and a stopwatch, so it
seems best to mention it now while things are still moving
slowly.
"And so we come," said Arthur, "to your knee. There is something
terribly and tragically wrong with your left knee."
"My left knee," said Fenchurch, "is absolutely fine."
"Do it is."
"Did you know that ..."
"What?"
"Ahm, it's all right. I can tell you do. No, keep going."
"So it has to be something to do with your feet ..."
She smiled in the dim light, and wriggled her shoulders
noncommittally against the cushions. Since there are cushions in
the Universe, on Squornshellous Beta to be exact, two worlds in
from the swampland of the mattresses, that actively enjoy being
wriggled against, particularly if it's noncommittally because of
the syncopated way in which the shoulders move, it's a pity they
weren't there. They weren't, but such is life.
Arthur held her left foot in his lap and looked it over
carefully. All kinds of stuff about the way her dress fell away
from her legs was making it difficult for him to think
particularly clearly at this point.
"I have to admit," he said, "that I really don't know what I'm
looking for."
"You'll know when you find it," she said. "Really you will."
There was a slight catch in her voice. "It's not that one."
Feeling increasingly puzzled, Arthur let her left foot down on
the floor and moved himself around so that he could take her
right foot. She moved forward, put her arms round and kissed him,
because the record had got to that bit which, if you knew the
record, you would know made it impossible not to do this.
Then she gave him her right foot.
He stroked it, ran his fingers round her ankle, under her toes,
along her instep, could find nothing wrong with it.
She watched him with great amusement, laughed and shook her head.
"No, don't stop," she said, but it's not that one now."
Arthur stopped, and frowned at her left foot on the floor.
"Don't stop."
He stroked her right foot, ran his fingers around her ankle,
under her toes, along her instep and said, "You mean it's
something to do with which leg I'm holding ...?"
She did another of the shrugs which would have brought such joy
into the life of a simple cushion from Squornshellous Beta.
He frowned.
"Pick me up," she said quietly.
He let her right foot down to the floor and stood up. So did she.
He picked her up in his arms and they kissed again. This went on
for a while, then she said, "Now put me down again."
Still puzzled, he did so.
"Well?"
She looked at him almost challengingly.
"So what's wrong with my feet?" she said.
Arthur still did not understand. He sat on the floor, then got
down on his hands and knees to look at her feet, in situ, as it
were, in their normal habitat. And as he looked closely,
something odd struck him. He pit his head right down to the
ground and peered. There was a long pause. He sat back heavily.
"Yes," he said, "I see what's wrong with your feet. They don't
touch the ground."
"So ... so what do you think ...?"
Arthur looked up at her quickly and saw the deep apprehension
making her eyes suddenly dark. She bit her lip and was trembling.
"What do ..." she stammered. "Are you ...?" She shook the hair
forwards over her eyes that were filling with dark fearful tears.
He stood up quickly, put his arms around her and gave her a
single kiss.
"Perhaps you can do what I can do," he said, and walked straight
out of her upstairs front door.
The record got to the good bit.
The battle raged on about the star of Xaxis. Hundreds of the
fierce and horribly beweaponed Zirzla ships had now been smashed
and wrenched to atoms by the withering forces the huge silver
Xaxisian ship was able to deploy.
Part of the moon had gone too, blasted away by those same blazing
forceguns that ripped the very fabric of space as they passed
through it.
The Zirzla ships that remained, horribly beweaponed though they
were, were now hopelessly outclassed by the devastating power of
the Xaxisian ship, and were fleeing for cover behind the rapidly
disintegrating moon, when the Xaxisian ship, in hurtling pursuit
behind them, suddenly announced that it needed a holiday and left
the field of battle.
All was redoubled fear and consternation for a moment, but the
ship was gone.
With the stupendous powers at its command it flitted across vast
tracts of irrationally shaped space, quickly, effortlessly, and
above all, quietly.
Deep in his greasy, smelly bunk, fashioned out of a maintenance
hatchway, Ford Prefect slept among his towels, dreaming of old
haunts. He dreamed at one point in his slumbers of New York.
In his dream he was walking late at night along the East Side,
beside the river which had become so extravagantly polluted that
new lifeforms were now emerging from it spontaneously, demanding
welfare and voting rights.
One of those now floated past, waving. Ford waved back.
The thing thrashed to the shore and struggled up the bank.
"Hi," it said, "I've just been created. I'm completely new to the
Universe in all respects. Is there anything you can tell me?"
"Phew," said Ford, a little nonplussed, "I can tell you where
some bars are, I guess."
"What about love and happiness. I sense deep needs for things
like that," it said, waving its tentacles. "Got any leads there?"
"You can get some like what you require," said Ford, "on Seventh
Avenue."
"I instinctively feel," said the creature, urgently, "that I need
to be beautiful. Am I?"
"You're pretty direct, aren't you?"
"No point in mucking about. Am I?"
"To me?" said Ford. "No. But listen," he added after a moment,
"most people make out, you know. Are there and like you down
there?"
"Search me, buster," said the creature, "as I said, I'm new here.
Life is entirely strange to me. What's it like?"
Here was something that Ford felt he could speak about with
authority.
"Life," he said, "is like a grapefruit."
"Er, how so?"
"Well, it's sort of orangey-yellow and dimpled on the outside,
wet and squidgy in the middle. It's got pips inside, too. Oh, and
some people have half a one for breakfast."
"Is there anyone else out there I can talk to?"
"I expect so," said Ford. "Ask a policeman."
Deep in his bunk, Ford Prefect wriggled and turned on to his
other side. It wasn't his favourite type of dream because it
didn't have Eccentrica Gallumbits, the Triple-Breasted Whore of
Eroticon in it, whom many of his dreams did feature. But at
least it was a dream. At least he was asleep.
Luckily there was a strong updraft in the alley because Arthur
hadn't done this sort of thing for a while, at least, not
deliberately, and deliberately is exactly the way you are not
meant to do it.
He swung down sharply, nearly catching himself a nasty crack on
the jaw with the doorstep and tumbled through the air, so
suddenly stunned with what a profoundly stupid thing he had just
done that he completely forgot the bit about hitting the ground
and didn't.
A nice trick, he thought to himself, if you can do it.
The ground was hanging menacingly above his head.
He tried not to think about the ground, what an extraordinarily
big thing it was and how much it would hurt him if it decided to
stop hanging there and suddenly fell on him. He tried to think
nice thoughts about lemurs instead, which was exactly the right
thing to do because he couldn't at that moment remember precisely
what a lemur was, if it was one of those things that sweep in
great majestic herds across the plains of wherever it was or if
that was wildebeests, so it was a tricky kind of thing to think
nice thoughts about without simply resorting to an icky sort of
general well-disposedness towards things, and all this kept his
mind well occupied while his body tried to adjust to the fact
that it wasn't touching anything.
A Mars bar wrapper fluttered down the alleyway.
After a seeming moment of doubt and indecision it eventually
allowed the wind to ease it, fluttering, between him and the
ground.
"Arthur ..."
The ground was still hanging menacingly above his head, and he
thought it was probably time to do something about that, such as
fall away from it, which is what he did. Slowly. Very, very
slowly.
As he fell slowly, very, very slowly, he closed his eyes -
carefully, so as not to jolt anything.
The feel of his eyes closing ran down his whole body. Once it had
reached his feet, and the whole of his body was alerted to the
fact that his eyes were now closed and was not panicked by it, he
slowly, very, very slowly, revolved his body one way and his mind
the other.
That should sort the ground out.
He could feel the air clear about him now, breezing around him
quite cheerfully, untroubled by his being there, and slowly,
very, very slowly, as from a deep and distant sleep, he opened
his eyes.
He had flown before, of course, flown many times on Krikkit until
all the birdtalk had driven him scatty, but this was different.
Here he was on his own world, quietly, and without fuss, beyond a
slight trembling which could have been attributable to a number
of things, being in the air.
Ten or fifteen feet below him was the hard tarmac and a few yards
off to the right the yellow street lights of Upper Street.
Luckily the alleyway was dark since the light which was supposed
to see it through the night was on an ingenious timeswitch which
meant it came on just before lunchtime and went off again as the
evening was beginning to draw in. He was, therefore, safely
shrouded in a blanket of dark obscurity.
He slowly, very, very slowly, lifted his head to Fenchurch, who
was standing in silent breathless amazement, silhouetted in her
upstairs doorway.
Her face was inches from his.
"I was about to ask you," she said in a low trembly voice, "what
you were doing. But then I realized that I could see what you
were doing. You were flying. So it seemed," she went on after a
slight wondering pause, "like a bit of a silly question."
Arthur said, "Can you do it?"
"No."
"Would you like to try?"
She bit her lip and shook her head, not so much to say no, but
just in sheer bewilderment. She was shaking like a leaf.
"It's quite easy," urged Arthur, "if you don't know how. That's
the important bit. Be not at all sure how you're doing it."
Just to demonstrate how easy it was he floated away down the
alley, fell upwards quite dramatically and bobbed back down to
her like a banknote on a breath of wind.
"Ask me how I did that."
"How ... did you do that?"
"No idea. Not a clue."
She shrugged in bewilderment. "So how can I ...?"
Arthur bobbed down a little lower and held out his hand.
"I want you to try," he said, "to step on my hand. Just one
foot."
"What?"
"Try it."
Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if she was
trying to step on the hand of someone who was floating in front
of her in midair, she stepped on to his hand.
"Now the other."
"What?"
"Take the weight off your back foot."
"I can't."
"Try it."
"Like this?"
"Like that."
Nervously, hesitantly, almost, she told herself, as if - She
stopped telling herself what what she was doing was like because
she had a feeling she didn't altogether want to know.
She fixed her eyes very very firmly on the guttering of the roof
of the decrepit warehouse opposite which had been annoying her
for weeks because it was clearly going to fall off and she
wondered if anyone was going to do anything about it or whether
she ought to say something to somebody, and didn't think for a
moment about the fact that she was standing on the hands of
someone who wasn't standing on anything at all.
"Now," said Arthur, "take your weight off your left foot."
She thought that the warehouse belonged to the carpet company who
had their offices round the corner, and took the weight off her
left foot, so she should probably go and see them about the
gutter.
"Now," said Arthur, "take the weight off your right foot."
"I can't."
"Try."
She hadn't seen the guttering from quite this angle before, and
it looked to her now as if as well as the mud and gunge up there
there might also be a bird's nest. If she leaned forward just a
little and took her weight off her right foot, she could probably
see it more clearly.
Arthur was alarmed to see that someone down in the alley was
trying to steal her bicycle. He particularly didn't want to get
involved in an argument at the moment and hoped that the guy
would do it quietly and not look up.
He had the quiet shifty look of someone who habitually stole
bicycles in alleys and habitually didn't expect to find their
owners hovering several feet above them. He was relaxed by both
these habits, and went about his job with purpose and
concentration, and when he found that the bike was unarguably
bound by hoops of tungsten carbide to an iron bar embedded in
concrete, he peacefully bent both its wheels and went on his way.
Arthur let out a long-held breath.
"See what a piece of eggshell I have found you," said Fenchurch
in his ear.
Those who are regular followers of the doings of Arthur Dent may
have received an impression of his character and habits which,
while it includes the truth and, of course, nothing but the
truth, falls somewhat short, in its composition, of the whole
truth in all its glorious aspects.
And the reasons for this are obvious. Editing, selection, the
need to balance that which is interesting with that which is
relevant and cut out all the tedious happenstance.
Like this for instance. "Arthur Dent went to bed. He went up the
stairs, all fifteen of them, opened the door, went into his room,
took off his shoes and socks and then all the rest of his clothes
one by one and left them in a neatly crumpled heap on the floor.
He put on his pyjamas, the blue ones with the stripe. He washed
his face and hands, cleaned his teeth, went to the lavatory,
realized that he had once again got this all in the wrong order,
had to wash his hands again and went to bed. He read for fifteen
minutes, spending the first ten minutes of that trying to work
out where in the book he had got to the previous night, then he
turned out the light and within a minute or so more was asleep.
"It was dark. He lay on his left side for a good hour.
"After that he moved restlessly in his sleep for a moment and
then turned over to sleep on his right side. Another hour after
this his eyes flickered briefly and he slightly scratched his
nose, though there was still a good twenty minutes to go before
he turned back on to his left side. And so he whiled the night
away, sleeping.
"At four he got up and went to the lavatory again. He opened the
door to the lavatory ..." and so on.
It's guff. It doesn't advance the action. It makes for nice fat
books such as the American market thrives on, but it doesn't
actually get you anywhere. You don't, in short, want to know.
But there are other omissions as well, beside the teethcleaning
and trying to find fresh socks variety, and in some of these
people have often seemed inordinately interested.
What, they want to know, about all that stuff off in the wings
with Arthur and Trillian, did that ever get anywhere?
To which the answer is, of course, mind your own business.
And what, they say, was he up to all those nights on the planet
Krikkit? Just because the planet didn't have Fuolornis Fire
Dragons or Dire Straits doesn't mean that everyone just sat up
every night reading.
Or to take a more specific example, what about the night after
the committee meeting party on Prehistoric Earth, when Arthur
found himself sitting on a hillside watching the moon rise over
the softly burning trees in company with a beautiful young girl
called Mella, recently escaped from a lifetime of staring every
morning at a hundred nearly identical photographs of moodily lit
tubes of toothpaste in the art department of an advertising
agency on the planet Golgafrincham. What then? What happened
next? And the answer is, of course, that the book ended.
The next one didn't resume the story till five years later, and
you can, claim some, take discretion too far. "This Arthur Dent,"
comes the cry from the furthest reaches of the galaxy, and has
even now been found inscribed on a mysterious deep space probe
thought to originate from an alien galaxy at a distance too
hideous to contemplate, "what is he, man or mouse? Is he
interested in nothing more than tea and the wider issues of life?
Has he no spirit? has he no passion? Does he not, to put it in a
nutshell, fuck?"
Those who wish to know should read on. Others may wish to skip on
to the last chapter which is a good bit and has Marvin in it.
Arthur Dent allowed himself for an unworthy moment to think, as
they drifted up, that he very much hoped that his friends who had
always found him pleasant but dull, or more latterly, odd but
dull, were having a good time in the pub, but that was the last
time, for a while, that he thought of them.
They drifted up, spiralling slowly around each other, like
sycamore seeds falling from sycamore trees in the autumn, except
going the other way.
And as they drifted up their minds sang with the ecstatic
knowledge that either what they were doing was completely and
utterly and totally impossible or that physics had a lot of
catching up to do.
Physics shook its head and, looking the other way, concentrated
on keeping the cars going along the Euston Road and out towards
the Westway flyover, on keeping the streetlights lit and on
making sure that when somebody on Baker Street dropped a
cheeseburger it went splat upon the ground.
Dwindling headily beneath them, the beaded strings of light of
London - London, Arthur had to keep reminding himself, not the
strangely coloured fields of Krikkit on the remote fringes of the
galaxy, lighted freckles of which faintly spanned the opening sky
above them, but London - swayed, swaying and turning, turned.
"Try a swoop," he called to Fenchurch.
"What?"
Her voice seemed strangely clear but distant in all the vast
empty air. It was breathy and faint with disbelief - all those
things, clear, faint, distant, breathy, all at the same time.
"We're flying ..." she said.
"A trifle," called Arthur, "think nothing of it. Try a swoop."
"A sw-"
Her hand caught his, and in a second her weight caught it too,
and stunningly, she was gone, tumbling beneath him, clawing
wildly at nothing.
Physics glanced at Arthur, and clotted with horror he was gone
too, sick with giddy dropping, every part of him screaming but
his voice.
They plummeted because this was London and you really couldn't do
this sort of thing here.
He couldn't catch her because this was London, and not a million
miles from here, seven hundred and fifty-six, to be exact, in
Pisa, Galileo had clearly demonstrated that two falling bodies
fell at exactly the same rate of acceleration irrespective of
their relative weights.
They fell.
Arthur realized as he fell, giddily and sickeningly, that if he
was going to hang around in the sky believing everything that the
Italians had to say about physics when they couldn't even keep a
simple tower straight, that they were in dead trouble, and damn
well did fall faster than Fenchurch.
He grappled her from above, and fumbled for a tight grip on her
shoulders. He got it.
Fine. They were now falling together, which was all very sweet
and romantic, but didn't solve the basic problem, which was that
they were falling, and the ground wasn't waiting around to see if
he had any more clever tricks up his sleeve, but was coming up to
meet them like an express train.
He couldn't support her weight, he hadn't anything he could
support it with or against. The only thing he could think was
that they were obviously going to die, and if he wanted anything
other than the obvious to happen he was going to have to do
something other than the obvious. Here he felt he was on familiar
territory.
He let go of her, pushed her away, and when she turned her face
to him in a gasp of stunned horror, caught her little finger with
his little finger and swung her back upwards, tumbling clumsily
up after her.
"Shit," she said, as she sat panting and breathless on absolutely
nothing at all, and when she had recovered herself they fled on
up into the night.
Just below cloud level they paused and scanned where they had
impossibly come. The ground was something not to regard with any
too firm or steady an eye, but merely to glance at, as it were,
in passing.
Fenchurch tried some little swoops, daringly, and found that if
she judged herself just right against a body of wind she could
pull off some really quite dazzling ones with a little pirouette
at the end, followed by a little drop which made her dress billow
around her, and this is where readers who are keen to know what
Marvin and Ford Prefect have been up to all this while should
look ahead to later chapters, because Arthur now could wait no
longer and helped her take it off.
It drifted down and away whipped by the wind until it was a speck
which finally vanished, and for various complicated reasons
revolutionized the life of a family on Hounslow, over whose
washing line it was discovered draped in the morning.
In a mute embrace, they drifted up till they were swimming
amongst the misty wraiths of moisture that you can see feathering
around the wings of an aeroplane but never feel because you are
sitting warm inside the stuffy aeroplane and looking through the
little scratchy perspex window while somebody else's son tries
patiently to pour warm milk into your shirt.
Arthur and Fenchurch could feel them, wispy cold and thin,
wreathing round their bodies, very cold, very thin. They felt,
even Fenchurch, now protected from the elements by only a couple
of fragments from Marks and Spencer, that if they were not going
to let the force of gravity bother them, then mere cold or
paucity of atmosphere could go and whistle.
The two fragments from Marks and Spencer which, as Fenchurch rose
now into the misty body of the clouds, Arthur removed very, very
slowly, which is the only way it's possible to do it when you're
flying and also not using your hands, went on to create
considerable havoc in the morning in, respectively, counting from
top to bottom, Isleworth and Richmond.
They were in the cloud for a long time, because it was stacked
very high, and when finally they emerged wetly above it,
Fenchurch slowly spinning like a starfish lapped by a rising
tidepool, they found that above the clouds is where the night get
seriously moonlit.
The light is darkly brilliant. There are different mountains up
there, but they are mountains, with their own white arctic snows.
They had emerged at the top of the high-stacked cumulo-nimbus,
and now began lazily to drift down its contours, as Fenchurch
eased Arthur in turn from his clothes, prised him free of them
till all were gone, winding their surprised way down into the
enveloping whiteness.
She kissed him, kissed his neck, his chest, and soon they were
drifting on, turning slowly, in a kind of speechless T-shape,
which might have caused even a Fuolornis Fire Dragon, had one
flown past, replete with pizza, to flap its wings and cough a
little.
There were, however, no Fuolornis Fire Dragons in the clouds nor
could there be for, like the dinosaurs, the dodos, and the
Greater Drubbered Wintwock of Stegbartle Major in the
constellation Fraz, and unlike the Boeing which is in
plentiful supply, they are sadly extinct, and the Universe shall
never know their like again.
The reason that a Boeing crops up rather unexpectedly in the
above list is not unconnected with the fact that something very
similar happened in the lives of Arthur and Fenchurch a moment or
two later.
They are big things, terrifyingly big. You know when one is in
the air with you. There is a thunderous attack of air, a moving
wall of screaming wind, and you get tossed aside, if you are
foolish enough to be doing anything remotely like what Arthur and
Fenchurch were doing in its close vicinity, like butterflies in
the Blitz.
This time, however, there was a heart-sickening fall or loss of
nerve, a re-grouping moments later and a wonderful new idea
enthusiastically signalled through the buffeting noise.
Mrs E. Kapelsen of Boston, Massachusetts was an elderly lady,
indeed, she felt her life was nearly at an end. She had seen a
lot of it, been puzzled by some, but, she was a little uneasy to
feel at this late stage, bored by too much. It had all been very
pleasant, but perhaps a little too explicable, a little too
routine.
With a sigh she flipped up the little plastic window shutter and
looked out over the wing.
At first she thought she ought to call the stewardess, but then
she thought no, damn it, definitely not, this was for her, and
her alone.
By the time her two inexplicable people finally slipped back off
the wing and tumbled into the slipstream she had cheered up an
awful lot.
She was mostly immensely relieved to think that virtually
everything that anybody had ever told her was wrong.
The following morning Arthur and Fenchurch slept very late in the
alley despite the continual wail of furniture being restored.
The following night they did it all over again, only this time
with Sony Walkmen.
"This is all very wonderful," said Fenchurch a few days later.
"But I do need to know what has happened to me. You see, there's
this difference between us. That you lost something and found it
again, and I found something and lost it. I need to find it
again."
She had to go out for the day, so Arthur settled down for a day
of telephoning.
Murray Bost Henson was a journalist on one of the papers with
small pages and big print. It would be pleasant to be able to say
that he was none the worse for it, but sadly, this was not the
case. He happened to be the only journalist that Arthur knew, so
Arthur phoned him anyway.
"Arthur my old soup spoon, my old silver turreen, how
particularly stunning to hear from you. Someone told me you'd
gone off into space or something."
Murray had his own special kind of conversation language which he
had invented for his own use, and which no one else was able to
speak or even to follow. Hardly any of it meant anything at all.
The bits which did mean anything were often so wonderfully buried
that no one could ever spot them slipping past in the avalance of
nonsense. The time when you did find out, later, which bits he
did mean, was often a bad time for all concerned.
"What?" said Arthur.
"Just a rumour my old elephant tusk, my little green baize card
table, just a rumour. Probably means nothing at all, but I may
need a quote from you."
"Nothing to say, just pub talk."
"We thrive on it, my old prosthetic limb, we thrive on it. Plus
it would fit like a whatsit in one of those other things with the
other stories of the week, so it could be just to have you
denying it. Excuse me, something has just fallen out of my ear."
There was a slight pause, at the end of which Murray Bost Henson
came back on the line sounding genuinely shaken.
"Just remembered," he said, "what an odd evening I had last
night. Anyway my old, I won't say what, how do you feel about
having ridden on Halley's Comet?"
"I haven't," said Arthur with a suppressed sigh, "ridden on
Halley's Comet."
"OK, How do you feel about not having ridden on Halley's Comet?"
"Pretty relaxed, Murray."
There was a pause while Murray wrote this down.
"Good enough for me, Arthur, good enough for Ethel and me and the
chickens. Fits in with the general weirdness of the week. Week of
the Weirdos, we're thinking of calling it. Good, eh?"
"Very good."
"Got a ring to it. First we have this man it always rains on."
"What?"
"It's the absolute stocking top truth. All documented in his
little black book, it all checks out at every single funloving
level. The Met Office is going ice cold thick banana whips, and
funny little men in white coats are flying in from all over the
world with their little rulers and boxes and drip feeds. This man
is the bee's knees, Arthur, he is the wasp's nipples. He is, I
would go so far as to say, the entire set of erogenous zones of
every major flying insect of the Western world. We're calling him
the Rain God. Nice, eh?"
"I think I've met him."
"Good ring to it. What did you say?"
"I may have met him. Complains all the time, yes?"
"Incredible! You met the Rain God?"
"If it's the same guy. I told him to stop complaining and show
someone his book."
There was an impressed pause from Murray Bost Henson's end of the
phone.
"Well, you did a bundle. An absolute bundle has absolutely been
done by you. Listen, do you know how much a tour operator is
paying that guy not to go to Malaga this year? I mean forget
irrigating the Sahara and boring stuff like that, this guy has a
whole new career ahead of him, just avoiding places for money.
The man's turning into a monster, Arthur, we might even have to
make him win the bingo.
"Listen, we may want to do a feature on you, Arthur, the Man Who
Made the Rain God Rain. Got a ring to it, eh?"
"A nice one, but ..."
"We may need to photograph you under a garden shower, but that'll
be OK. Where are you?"
"Er, I'm in Islington. Listen, Murray ..."
"Islington!"
"Yes ..."
"Well, what about the real weirdness of the week, the real
seriously loopy stuff. You know anything about these flying
people?"
"No."
"You must have. This is the real seethingly crazy one. This is
the real meatballs in the batter. Locals are phoning in all the
time to say there's this couple who go flying nights. We've got
guys down in our photo labs working through the night to put
together a genuine photograph. You must have heard."
"No."
"Arthur, where have you been? Oh, space, right, I got your quote.
But that was months ago. Listen, it's night after night this
week, my old cheesegrater, right on your patch. This couple just
fly around the sky and start doing all kinds of stuff. And I
don't mean looking through walls or pretending to be box girder
bridges. You don't know anything?"
"No."
"Arthur, it's been almost inexpressibly delicious conversing with
you, chumbum, but I have to go. I'll send the guy with the camera
and the hose. Give me the address, I'm ready and writing."
"Listen, Murray, I called to ask you something."
"I have a lot to do."
"I just wanted to find out something about the dolphins."
"No story. Last year's news. Forget 'em. They're gone."
"It's important."
"Listen, no one will touch it. You can't sustain a story, you
know, when the only news is the continuing absence of whatever
the story's about. Not our territory anyway, try the Sundays.
Maybe they'll run a little Whatever Happened to "Whatever
Happened to the Dolphins"' story in a couple of years, around
August. But what's anybody going to do now? Dolphins still
gone'? Continuing Dolphin Absence'? Dolphins - Further Days
Without Them'? The story dies, Arthur. It lies down and kicks its
little feet in the air and presently goes to the great golden
spike in the sky, my old fruitbat."
"Murray, I'm not interested in whether it's a story. I just want
to find out how I can get in touch with that guy in California
who claims to know something about it. I thought you might know."
"People are beginning to talk," said Fenchurch that evening,
after they had hauled her 'cello in.
"Not only talk," said Arthur, "but print, in big bold letters
under the bingo prizes. Which is why I thought I'd better get
these."
He showed her the long narrow booklets of airline tickets.
"Arthur!" she said, hugging him. "Does that mean you managed to
talk to him?"
"I have had a day," said Arthur, "of extreme telephonic
exhaustion. I have spoken to virtually every department of
virtually every paper in Fleet street, and I finally tracked his
number down."
"You've obviously been working hard, you're drenched with sweat
poor darling."
"Not with sweat," said Arthur wearily. "A photographer's just
been. I tried to argue, but - never mind, the point is, yes."
"You spoke to him."
"I spoke to his wife. She said he was too weird to come to the
phone right now and could I call back."
He sat down heavily, realized he was missing something and went
to the fridge to find it.
"Want a drink?"
"Would commit murder to get one. I always know I'm in for a tough
time when my 'cello teacher looks me up and down and says, Ah
yes, my dear, I think a little Tchaikovsky today.'."
"I called again," said Arthur, "and she said that he was .
light years from the phone and I should call back."
"Ah."
"I called again. "She said the situation had improved. He was now
a mere . light years from the phone but it was still a long way
to shout."
"You don't suppose," said Fenchurch, doubtfully, "that there's
anyone else we can talk to?"
"It gets worse," said Arthur, "I spoke to someone on a science
magazine who actually knows him, and he said that John Watson
will not only believe, but will actually have absolute proof,
often dictated to him by angels with golden beards and green
wings and Doctor Scholl footwear, that the month's most
fashionable silly theory is true. For people who question the
validity of these visions he will triumphantly produce the clogs
in question, and that's as far as you get."
"I didn't realize it was that bad," said Fenchurch quietly. She
fiddled listlessly with the tickets.
"I phoned Mrs Watson again," said Arthur. "Her name, by the way,
and you may wish to know this, is Arcane Jill."
"I see."
"I'm glad you see. I thought you mightn't believe any of this, so
when I called her this time I used the telephone answering
machine to record the call."
He went across to the telephone machine and fiddled and fumed
with all its buttons for a while, because it was the one which
was particularly recommended by Which? magazine and is almost
impossible to use without going mad.
"Here it is," he said at last, wiping the sweat from his brow.
The voice was thin and crackly with its journey to a
geostationary satellite and back, but it was also hauntingly
calm.
"Perhaps I should explain," Arcane Jill Watson's voice said,
"that the phone is in fact in a room that he never comes into.
It's in the Asylum you see. Wonko the Sane does not like to enter
the Asylum and so he does not. I feel you should know this
because it may save you phoning. If you would like to meet him,
this is very easily arranged. All you have to do is walk in. He
will only meet people outside the Asylum."
Arthur's voice, at its most mystified: "I'm sorry, I don't
understand. Where is the asylum?"
"Where is the Asylum?" Arcane Jill Watson again. "Have you ever
read the instructions on a packet of toothpicks?"
On the tape, Arthur's voice had to admit that he had not.
"You may want to do that. You may find that it clarifies things
for you a little. You may find that it indicates to you where the
Asylum is. Thank you."
The sound of the phone line went dead. Arthur turned the machine
off.
"Well, I suppose we can regard that as an invitation," he said
with a shrug. "I actually managed to get the address from the guy
on the science magazine."
Fenchurch looked up at him again with a thoughtful frown, and
looked at the tickets again.
"Do you think it's worth it?" she said.
"Well," said Arthur, "the one thing that everyone I spoke to
agrees on, apart from the fact that they all thought he was
barking mad, is that he does know more than any man living about
dolphins."
"This is an important announcement. This is flight to Los
Angeles. If your travel plans today do not include Los Angeles,
now would be the perfect time to disembark."
They rented a car in Los Angeles from one of the places that
rents out cars that other people have thrown away.
"Getting it to go round corners is a bit of a problem," said the
guy behind the sunglasses as he handed them the keys, "sometimes
it's simpler just to get out and find a car that's going in that
direction."
They stayed for one night in a hotel on Sunset Boulevard which
someone had told them they would enjoy being puzzled by.
"Everyone there is either English or odd or both. They've got a
swimming pool where you can go and watch English rock stars
reading Language, Truth and Logic for the photographers."
It was true. There was one and that was exactly what he was
doing.
The garage attendant didn't think much of their car, but that was
fine because they didn't either.
Late in the evening they drove through the Hollywood hills along
Mulholland Drive and stopped to look out first over the dazzling
sea of floating light that is Los Angeles, and later stopped to
look across the dazzling sea of floating light that is the San
Fernando Valley. They agreed that the sense of dazzle stopped
immediately at the back of their eyes and didn't touch any other
part of them and came away strangely unsatisfied by the
spectacle. As dramatic seas of light went, it was fine, but light
is meant to illuminate something, and having driven through what
this particularly dramatic sea of light was illuminating they
didn't think much of it.
They slept late and restlessly and awoke at lunchtime when it was
stupidly hot.
They drove out along the freeway to Santa Monica for their first
look at the Pacific Ocean, the ocean which Wonko the Sane spent
all his days and a good deal of his nights looking at.
"Someone told me," said Fenchurch, "that they once overheard two
old ladies on this beach, doing what we're doing, looking at the
Pacific Ocean for the first time in their lives. And apparently,
after a long pause, one of them said to the other, You know,
it's not as big as I expected.'"
Their mood lifted further as the sun began to move down the
western half of the sky, and by the time they were back in their
rattling car and driving towards a sunset that no one of any
sensibility would dream of building a city like Los Angeles on
front of, they were suddenly feeling astonishingly and
irrationally happy and didn't even mind that the terrible old car
radio would only play two stations, and those simultaneously. So
what, they were both playing good rock and roll.
"I know he will be able to help us," said Fenchurch determinedly.
"I know he will. What's his name again, that he likes to be
called?"
"Wonko the Sane."
"I know that he will be able to help us."
Arthur wondered if he would and hoped that he would, and hoped
that what Fenchurch had lost could be found here, on this Earth,
whatever this Earth might prove to be.
He hoped, as he had hoped continually and fervently since the
time they had talked together on the banks of the Serpentine,
that he would not be called upon to try to remember something
that he had very firmly and deliberately buried in the furthest
recesses of his memory, where he hoped it would cease to nag at
him.
In Santa Barbara they stopped at a fish restaurant in what seemed
to be a converted warehouse.
Fenchurch had red mullet and said it was delicious.
Arthur had a swordfish steak and said it made him angry.
He grabbed a passing waitress by the arm and berated her.
"Why's this fish so bloody good?" he demanded, angrily.
"Please excuse my friend," said Fenchurch to the startled
waitress. "I think he's having a nice day at last."
If you took a couple of David Bowies and stuck one of the David
Bowies on the top of the other David Bowie, then attached another
David Bowie to the end of each of the arms of the upper of the
first two David Bowies and wrapped the whole business up in a
dirty beach robe you would then have something which didn't
exactly look like John Watson, but which those who knew him would
find hauntingly familiar.
He was tall and he gangled.
When he sat in his deckchair gazing at the Pacific, not so much
with any kind of wild surmise any longer as with a peaceful deep
dejection, it was a little difficult to tell exactly where the
deckchair ended and he began, and you would hesitate to put your
hand on, say, his forearm in case the whole structure suddenly
collapsed with a snap and took your thumb off.
But his smile when he turned it on you was quite remarkable. It
seemed to be composed of all the worst things that life can do to
you, but which, when he briefly reassembled them in that
particular order on his face, made you suddenly fee, "Oh. Well
that's all right then."
When he spoke, you were glad that he used the smile that made you
feel like that pretty often.
"Oh yes," he said, "they come and see me. They sit right here.
They sit right where you're sitting."
He was talking of the angels with the golden beards and green
wings and Dr Scholl sandals.
"They eat nachos which they say they can't get where they come
from. They do a lot of coke and are very wonderful about a whole
range of things."
"Do they?" said Arthur. "Are they? So, er ... when is this then?
When do they come?"
He gazed out at the Pacific as well. There were little sandpipers
running along the margin of the shore which seemed to have this
problem: they needed to find their food in the sand which a wave
had just washed over, but they couldn't bear to get their feet
wet. To deal with this problem they ran with an odd kind of
movement as if they'd been constructed by somebody very clever in
Switzerland.
Fenchurch was sitting on the sand, idly drawing patterns in it
with her fingers.
"Weekends, mostly," said Wonko the Sane, "on little scooters.
They are great machines." He smiled.
"I see," said Arthur. "I see."
A tiny cough from Fenchurch attracted his attention and he looked
round at her. She had scratched a little stick figure drawing in
the sand of the two of them in the clouds. For a moment he
thought she was trying to get him excited, then he realized that
she was rebuking him. "Who are we," she was saying, "to say he's
mad?"
His house was certainly peculiar, and since this was the first
thing that Fenchurch and Arthur had encountered it would help to
know what it was like.
What it was like was this:
It was inside out.
Actually inside out, to the extent that they had to park on the
carpet.
All along what one would normally call the outer wall, which was
decorated in a tasteful interior-designed pink, were bookshelves,
also a couple of those odd three-legged tables with semi-circular
tops which stand in such a way as to suggest that someone just
dropped the wall straight through them, and pictures which were
clearly designed to soothe.
Where it got really odd was the roof.
It folded back on itself like something that Maurits C. Escher,
had he been given to hard nights on the town, which is no part of
this narrative's purpose to suggest was the case, though it is
sometimes hard, looking at his pictures, particularly the one
with the awkward steps, not to wonder, might have dreamed up
after having been on one, for the little chandeliers which should
have been hanging inside were on the outside pointing up.
Confusing.
The sign above the front door said, "Come Outside", and so,
nervously, they had.
Inside, of course, was where the Outside was. Rough brickwork,
nicely done painting, guttering in good repair, a garden path, a
couple of small trees, some rooms leading off.
And the inner walls stretched down, folded curiously, and opened
at the end as if, by an optical illusion which would have had
Maurits C. Escher frowning and wondering how it was done, to
enclose the Pacific Ocean itself.
"Hello," said John Watson, Wonko the Sane.
Good, they thought to themselves, "Hello" is something we can
cope with.
"Hello," they said, and all surprisingly was smiles.
For quite a while he seemed curiously reluctant to talk about the
dolphins, looking oddly distracted and saying, "I forget ..."
whenever they were mentioned, and had shown them quite proudly
round the eccentricities of his house.
"It gives me pleasure," he said, "in a curious kind of way, and
does nobody any harm," he continued, "that a competent optician
couldn't correct."
They liked him. He had an open, engaging quality and seemed able
to mock himself before anybody else did.
"Your wife," said Arthur, looking around, "mentioned some
toothpicks." He said it with a hunted look, as if he was worried
that she might suddenly leap out from behind the door and mention
them again.
Wonko the Sane laughed. It was a light easy laugh, and sounded
like one he had used a lot before and was happy with.
"Ah yes," he said, "that's to so with the day I finally realized
that the world had gone totally mad and built the Asylum to put
it in, poor thing, and hoped it would get better."
This was the point at which Arthur began to feel a little nervous
again.
"Here," said Wonko the Sane, "we are outside the Asylum." He
pointed again at the rough brickwork, the pointing and the
guttering. "Go through that door," he pointed at the first door
through which they had originally entered, "and you go into the
Asylum. I've tried to decorate it nicely to keep the inmates
happy, but there's very little one can do. I never go in there
now myself. If ever I am tempted, which these days I rarely am, I
simply look at the sign written over the door and shy away."
"That one?" said Fenchurch, pointing, rather puzzled, at a blue
plaque with some instructions written on it.
"Yes. They are the words that finally turned me into the hermit I
have now become. It was quite sudden. I saw them, and I knew what
I had to do."
The sign said:
Hold stick near centre of its length. Moisten pointed end in
mouth. insert in tooth space, blunt end next to gum. Use gentle
in-out motion.
"It seemed to me," said Wonko the sane, "that any civilization
that had so far lost its head as to need to include a set of
detailed instructions for use in a packet of toothpicks, was no
longer a civilization in which I could live and stay sane."
He gazed out at the Pacific again, as if daring it to rave and
gibber at him, but it lay there calmly and played with the
sandpipers.
"And in case it crossed your mind to wonder, as I can see how it
possibly might, I am completely sane. Which is why I call myself
Wonko the Sane, just to reassure people on this point. Wonko is
what my mother called me when I was a kid and clumsy and knocked
things over, and sane is what I am, and how," he added, with one
of his smiles that made you feel, "Oh. Well that's all right
then." "I intend to remain. Shall we go on to the beach and see
what we have to talk about?"
They went out on to the beach, which was where he started talking
about angels with golden beards and green wings and Dr Scholl
sandals.
"About the dolphins ..." said Fenchurch gently, hopefully.
"I can show you the sandals," said Wonko the Sane.
"I wonder, do you know ..."
"Would you like me to show you," said Wonko the Sane, "the
sandals? I have them. I'll get them. They are made by the Dr
Scholl company, and the angels say that they particularly suit
the terrain they have to work in. They say they run a concession
stand by the message. When I say I don't know what that means
they say no, you don't, and laugh. Well, I'll get them anyway."
As he walked back towards the inside, or the outside depending on
how you looked at it, Arthur and Fenchurch looked at each other
in a wondering and slightly desperate sort of way, then each
shrugged and idly drew figures in the sand.
"How are the feet today?" said Arthur quietly.
"OK. It doesn't feel so odd in the sand. Or in the water. The
water touches them perfectly. I just think this isn't our world."
She shrugged.
"What do you think he meant," she said, "by the message?"
"I don't know," said Arthur, though the memory of a man called
Prak who laughed at him continuously kept nagging at him.
When Wonko returned he was carrying something that stunned
Arthur. Not the sandals, they were perfectly ordinary wooden-
bottomed sandals.
"I just thought you'd like to see," he said, "what angels wear on
their feet. Just out of curiousity. I'm not trying to prove
anything, by the way. I'm a scientist and I know what constitutes
proof. But the reason I call myself by my childhood name is to
remind myself that a scientist must also be absolutely like a
child. If he sees a thing, he must say that he sees it, whether
it was what he thought he was going to see or not. See first,
think later, then test. But always see first. Otherwise you will
only see what you were expecting. Most scientists forget that.
I'll show you something to demonstrate that later. So, the other
reason I call myself Wonko the Sane is so that people will think
I am a fool. That allows me to say what I see when I see it. You
can't possibly be a scientist if you mind people thinking that
you're a fool. Anyway, I also thought you might like to see
this."
This was the thing that Arthur had been stunned to see him
carrying, for it was a wonderful silver-grey glass fish bowl,
seemingly identical to the one in Arthur's bedroom.
Arthur had been trying for some thirty seconds now, without
success, to say, "Where did you get that?" sharply, and with a
gasp in his voice.
Finally his time had come, but he missed it by a millisecond.
"Where did you get that?" said Fenchurch, sharply and with a gasp
in her voice.
Arthur glanced at Fenchurch sharply and with a gasp in his voice
said, "What? Have you seen one of these before?"
"Yes," she said, "I've got one. Or at least I did have. Russell
nicked it to put his golfballs in. I don't know where it came
from, just that I was angry with Russell for nicking it. Why,
have you got one?"
"Yes, it was ..."
They both became aware that Wonko the Sane was glancing sharply
backwards and forwards between them, and trying to get a gasp in
edgeways.
"You have one of those too?" he said to both of them.
"Yes." They both said it.
He looked long and calmly at each of them, then he held up the
bowl to catch the light of the Californian sun.
The bowl seemed almost to sing with the sun, to chime with the
intensity of its light, and cast darkly brilliant rainbows around
the sand and upon them. He turned it, and turned it. They could
see quite clearly in the fine tracery of its etchwork the words
"So Long, and Thanks For All The Fish."
"Do you know," asked Wonko quietly, "what it is?"
They each shook their heads slowly, and with wonder, almost
hypnotized by the flashing of the lightning shadows in the grey
glass.
"It is a farewell gift from the dolphins," said Wonko in a low
quiet voice, "the dolphins whom I loved and studied, and swam
with, and fed with fish, and even tried to learn their language,
a task which they seemed to make impossibly difficult,
considering the fact that I now realize they were perfectly
capable of communicating in ours if they decided they wanted to."
He shook his head with a slow, slow smile, and then looked again
at Fenchurch, and then at Arthur.
"Have you ..." he said to Arthur, "what have you done with yours?
May I ask you that?"
"Er, I keep a fish in it," said Arthur, slightly embarrassed. "I
happened to have this fish I was wondering what to do with, and,
er, there was this bowl." He tailed off.
"You've done nothing else? No," he said, "if you had, you would
know." He shook his head again.
"My wife kept wheatgerm in ours," resumed Wonko, with some new
tone in his voice, "until last night ..."
"What," said Arthur slowly and hushedly, "happened last night?"
"We ran out of wheatgerm," said Wonko, evenly. "My wife," he
added, "has gone to get some more." He seemed lost with his own
thoughts for a moment.
"And what happened then?" said Fenchurch, in the same breathless
tone.
"I washed it," said Wonko. "I washed it very carefully, very very
carefully, removing every last speck of wheatgerm, then I dried
it slowly with a lint-free cloth, slowly, carefully, turning it
over and over. Then I held it to my ear. Have you ... have you
held one to your ear?"
They both shook their heads, again slowly, again dumbly.
"Perhaps," he said, "you should."
The deep roar of the ocean.
The break of waves on further shores than thought can find.
The silent thunders of the deep.
And from among it, voices calling, and yet not voices, humming
trillings, wordlings, the half-articulated songs of thought.
Greetings, waves of greetings, sliding back down into the
inarticulate, words breaking together.
A crash of sorrow on the shores of Earth.
Waves of joy on - where? A world indescribably found,
indescribably arrived at, indescribably wet, a song of water.
A fugue of voices now, clamouring explanations, of a disaster
unavertable, a world to be destroyed, a surge of helplessness, a
spasm of despair, a dying fall, again the break of words.
And then the fling of hope, the finding of a shadow Earth in the
implications of enfolded time, submerged dimensions, the pull of
parallels, the deep pull, the spin of will, the hurl and split of
it, the flight. A new Earth pulled into replacement, the dolphins
gone.
Then stunningly a single voice, quite clear.
"This bowl was brought to you by the Campaign to Save the Humans.
We bid you farewell."
And then the sound of long, heavy, perfectly grey bodies rolling
away into an unknown fathomless deep, quietly giggling.
That night they stayed Outside the Asylum and watched TV from
inside it.
"This is what I wanted you to see," said Wonko the Sane when the
news came around again, "an old colleague of mine. He's over in
your country running an investigation. Just watch."
It was a press conference.
"I'm afraid I can't comment on the name Rain God at this present
time, and we are calling him an example of a Spontaneous Para-
Causal Meteorological Phenomenon."
"Can you tell us what that means?"
"I'm not altogether sure. Let's be straight here. If we find
something we can't understand we like to call it something you
can't understand, or indeed pronounce. I mean if we just let you
go around calling him a Rain God, then that suggests that you
know something we don't, and I'm afraid we couldn't have that.
"No, first we have to call it something which says it's ours, not
yours, then we set about finding some way of proving it's not
what you said it is, but something we say it is.
"And if it turns out that you're right, you'll still be wrong,
because we will simply call him a ... er Supernormal ...' - not
paranormal or supernatural because you think you know what those
mean now, no, a Supernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer'.
We'll probably want to shove a Quasi' in there somewhere to
protect ourselves. Rain God! Huh, never heard such nonsense in my
life. Admittedly, you wouldn't catch me going on holiday with
him. Thanks, that'll be all for now, other than to say Hi!' to
Wonko if he's watching."
On the way home there was a woman sitting next to them on the
plane who was looking at them rather oddly.
They talked quietly to themselves.
"I still have to know," said Fenchurch, "and I strongly feel that
you know something that you're not telling me."
Arthur sighed and took out a piece of paper.
"Do you have a pencil?" he said. She dug around and found one.
"What are you doing, sweetheart?" she said, after he had spent
twenty minutes frowning, chewing the pencil, scribbling on the
paper, crossing things out, scribbling again, chewing the pencil
again and grunting irritably to himself.
"Trying to remember an address someone once gave me."
"Your life would be an awful lot simpler," she said, "if you
bought yourself an address book."
Finally he passed the paper to her.
"You look after it," he said.
She looked at it. Among all the scratchings and crossings out
were the words "Quentulus Quazgar Mountains. Sevorbeupstry.
Planet of Preliumtarn. Sun-Zarss. Galactic Sector QQ Active J
Gamma."
"And what's there?"
"Apparently," said Arthur, "it's God's Final Message to His
Creation."
"That sounds a bit more like it," said Fenchurch. "How do we get
there?"
"You really ...?"
"Yes," said Fenchurch firmly, "I really want to know."
Arthur looked out of the scratchy little perspex window at the
open sky outside.
"Excuse me," said the woman who had been looking at them rather
oddly, suddenly, "I hope you don't think I'm rude. I get so bored
on these long flights, it's nice to talk to somebody. My name's
Enid Kapelsen, I'm from Boston. Tell me, do you fly a lot?"
They went to Arthur's house in the West Country, shoved a couple
of towels and stuff in a bag, and then sat down to do what every
Galactic hitch hiker ends up spending most of his time doing.
They waited for a flying saucer to come by.
"Friend of mine did this for fifteen years," said Arthur one
night as they sat forlornly watching the sky.
"Who was that?"
"Called Ford Prefect."
He caught himself doing something he had never really expected to
do again.
He wondered where Ford Prefect was.
By an extraordinary coincidence, the following day there were two
reports in the paper, one concerning the most astonishing
incidents with a flying saucer, and the other about a series of
unseemly riots in pubs.
Ford Prefect turned up the day after that looking hung over and
complaining that Arthur never answered the phone.
In fact he looked extremely ill, not merely as if he'd been
pulled through a hedge backwards, but as if the hedge was being
simultaneously pulled backwards through a combine harvester. He
staggered into Arthur's sitting room, waving aside all offers of
support, which was an error, because the effort caused him to
lose his balance altogether and Arthur had eventually to drag him
to the sofa.
"Thank you," said Ford, "thank you very much. Have you ..." he
said, and fell asleep for three hours.
"... the faintest idea" he continued suddenly, when he revived,
"how hard it is to tap into the British phone system from the
Pleiades? I can see that you haven't, so I'll tell you," he said,
"over the very large mug of black coffee that you are about to
make me."
He followed Arthur wobbily into the kitchen.
"Stupid operators keep asking you where you're calling from and
you try and tell them Letchworth and they say you couldn't be if
you're coming in on that circuit. What are you doing?"
"Making you some black coffee."
"Oh." Ford seemed oddly disappointed. He looked about the place
forlornly.
"What's this?" he said.
"Rice Crispies."
"And this?"
"Paprika."
"I see," said Ford, solemnly, and put the two items back down,
one on top of the other, but that didn't seem to balance
properly, so he put the other on top of the one and that seemed
to work.
"A little space-lagged," he said. "What was I saying?"
"About not phoning from Letchworth."
"I wasn't. I explained this to the lady. Bugger Letchworth,' I
said, if that's your attitude. I am in fact calling from a sales
scoutship of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation, currently on the
sub-light-speed leg of a journey between the stars known on your
world, though not necessarily to you, dear lady.' - I said dear
lady'," explained Ford Prefect, "because I didn't want her to be
offended by my implication that she was an ignorant cretin ..."
"Tactful," said Arthur Dent.
"Exactly," said Ford, "tactful."
He frowned.
"Space-lag," he said, "is very bad for sub-clauses. You'll have
to assist me again," he continued, "by reminding me what I was
talking about."
"Between the stars,'" said Arthur, "known on your world, though
not necessarily to you, dear lady, as ...'"
"Pleiades Epsilon and Pleiades Zeta,'" concluded Ford
triumphantly. "This conversation lark is quite gas isn't it?"
"Have some coffee."
"Thank you, no. And the reason,' I said, why I am bothering you
with it rather than just dialling direct as I could, because we
have some pretty sophisticated telecommunications equipment out
here in the Pleiades, I can tell you, is that the penny pinching
son of a starbeast piloting this son of a starbeast spaceship
insists that I call collect. Can you believe that?'"
"And could she?"
"I don't know. She had hung up," said Ford, "by this time. So!
What do you suppose," he asked fiercely, "I did next?"
"I've no idea, Ford," said Arthur.
"Pity," said Ford, "I was hoping you could remind me. I really
hate those guys you know. They really are the creeps of the
cosmos, buzzing around the celestial infinite with their junky
little machines that never work properly or, when they do,
perform functions that no sane man would require of them and," he
added savagely, "go beep to tell you when they've done it!"
This was perfectly true, and a very respectable view widely held
by right thinking people, who are largely recognizable as being
right thinking people by the mere fact that they hold this view.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, in a moment of reasoned
lucidity which is almost unique among its current tally of five
million, nine hundred and seventy-five thousand, five hundred and
nine pages, says of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation product
that "it is very easy to be blinded to the essential uselessness
of them by the sense of achievement you get from getting them to
work at all.
"In other words - and this is the rock solid principle on which
the whole of the Corporation's Galaxy-wide success is founded -
their fundamental design flaws are completely hidden by their
superficial design flaws."
"And this guy," ranted Ford, "was on a drive to sell more of
them! His five-year mission to seek out and explore strange new
worlds, and sell Advanced Music Substitute Systems to their
restaurants, elevators and wine bars! Or if they didn't have
restaurants, elevators and wine bars yet, to artificially
accelerate their civilization growth until they bloody well did
have! Where's that coffee!"
"I threw it away."
"Make some more. I have now remembered what I did next. I saved
civilization as we know it. I knew it was something like that."
He stumbled determinedly back into the sitting room, where he
seemed to carry on talking to himself, tripping over the
furniture and making beep beep noises.
A couple of minutes later, wearing his very placid face, Arthur
followed him.
Ford looked stunned.
"Where have you been?" he demanded.
"Making some coffee," said Arthur, still wearing his very placid
face. He had long ago realized that the only way of being in
Ford's company successfully was to keep a large stock of very
placid faces and wear them at all times.
"You missed the best bit!" raged Ford. "You missed the bit where
I jumped the guy! Now," he said, "I shall have to jump him, all
over him!"
He hurled himself recklessly at a chair and broke it.
"It was better," he said sullenly, "last time," and waved vaguely
in the direction of another broken chair which he had already got
trussed up on the dining table.
"I see," said Arthur, casting a placid eye over the trussed up
wreckage, "and, er, what are all the ice cubes for?"
"What?" screamed Ford. "What? You missed that bit too? That's the
suspended animation facility! I put the guy in the suspended
animation facility. Well I had to didn't I?"
"So it would seem," said Arthur, in his placid voice.
"Don't touch that!!!" yelled Ford.
Arthur, who was about to replace the phone, which was for some
mysterious reason lying on the table, off the hook, paused,
placidly.
"OK," said Ford, calming down, "listen to it."
Arthur put the phone to his ear.
"It's the speaking clock," he said.
"Beep, beep, beep," said Ford, "is exactly what is being heard
all over that guy's ship, while he sleeps, in the ice, going
slowly round a little-known moon of Sesefras Magna. The London
Speaking Clock!"
"I see," said Arthur again, and decided that now was the time to
ask the big one.
"Why?" he said, placidly.
"With a bit of luck," said Ford, "the phone bill will bankrupt
the buggers."
He threw himself, sweating, on to the sofa.
"Anyway," he said, "dramatic arrival don't you think?"
The flying saucer in which Ford Prefect had stowed away had
stunned the world.
Finally there was no doubt, no possibility of mistake, no
hallucinations, no mysterious CIA agents found floating in
reservoirs.
This time it was real, it was definite. It was quite definitely
definite.
It had come down with a wonderful disregard for anything beneath
it and crushed a large area of some of the most expensive real
estate in the world, including much of Harrods.
The thing was massive, nearly a mile across, some said, dull
silver in colour, pitted, scorched and disfigured with the scars
of unnumbered vicious space battles fought with savage forces by
the light of suns unknown to man.
A hatchway opened, crashed down through the Harrods Food Halls,
demolished Harvey Nicholls, and with a final grinding scream of
tortured architecture, toppled the Sheraton Park Tower.
After a long, heart-stopping moment of internal crashes and
grumbles of rending machinery, there marched from it, down the
ramp, an immense silver robot, a hundred feet tall.
It held up a hand.
"I come in peace," it said, adding after a long moment of further
grinding, "take me to your Lizard."
Ford Prefect, of course, had an explanation for this, as he sat
with Arthur and watched the non-stop frenetic news reports on the
television, none of which had anything to say other than to
record that the thing had done this amount of damage which was
valued at that amount of billions of pounds and had killed this
totally other number of people, and then say it again, because
the robot was doing nothing more than standing there, swaying
very slightly, and emitting short incomprehensible error
messages.
"It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see ..."
"You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?"
"No," said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and
coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced
down him, "nothing so simple. Nothing anything like so
straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders
are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards role the
people."
"Odd," said Arthur, "I thought you said it was a democracy."
"I did," said Ford. "It is."
"So," said Arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse,
"why don't people get rid of the lizards?"
"It honestly doesn't occur to them," said Ford. "They've all got
the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government
they've voted in more or less approximates to the government they
want."
"You mean they actually vote for the lizards?"
"Oh yes," said Ford with a shrug, "of course."
"But," said Arthur, going for the big one again, "why?"
"Because if they didn't vote for a lizard," said Ford, "the wrong
lizard might get in. Got any gin?"
"What?"
"I said," said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping
into his voice, "have you got any gin?"
"I'll look. Tell me about the lizards."
Ford shrugged again.
"Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever
happened to them," he said. "They're completely wrong of course,
completely and utterly wrong, but someone's got to say it."
"But that's terrible," said Arthur.
"Listen, bud," said Ford, "if I had one Altairan dollar for every
time I heard one bit of the Universe look at another bit of the
Universe and say That's terrible' I wouldn't be sitting here
like a lemon looking for a gin. But I haven't and I am. Anyway,
what are you looking so placid and moon-eyed for? Are you in
love?"
Arthur said yes, he was, and said it placidly.
"With someone who knows where the gin bottle is? Do I get to meet
her?"
He did because Fenchurch came in at that moment with a pile of
newspapers she'd been into the village to buy. She stopped in
astonishment at the wreckage on the table and the wreckage from
Betelgeuse on the sofa.
"Where's the gin?" said Ford to Fenchurch. And to Arthur, "What
happened to Trillian by the way?"
"Er, this is Fenchurch," said Arthur, awkwardly. "There was
nothing with Trillian, you must have seen her last."
"Oh, yeah," said Ford, "she went off with Zaphod somewhere. They
had some kids or something. At least," he added, "I think that's
what they were. Zaphod's calmed down a lot you know."
"Really?" said Arthur, clustering hurriedly round Fenchurch to
relieve her of the shopping.
"Yeah," said Ford, "at least one of his heads is now saner than
an emu on acid."
"Arthur, who is this?" said Fenchurch.
"Ford Prefect," said Arthur. "I may have mentioned him in
passing."
For a total of three days and nights the giant silver robot stood
in stunned amazement straddling the remains of Knightsbridge,
swaying slightly and trying to work out a number of things.
Government deputations came to see it, ranting journalists by the
truckload asked each other questions on the air about what they
thought of it, flights of fighter bombers tried pathetically to
attack it - but no lizards appeared. It scanned the horizon
slowly.
At night it was at its most spectacular, floodlit by the teams of
television crews who covered it continuously as it continuously
did nothing.
It thought and thought and eventually reached a conclusion.
It would have to send out its service robots.
It should have thought of that before, but it was having a number
of problems.
The tiny flying robots came screeching out of the hatchway one
afternoon in a terrifying cloud of metal. They roamed the
surrounding terrain, frantically attacking some things and
defending others.
One of them at last found a pet shop with some lizards, but it
instantly defended the pet shop for democracy so savagely that
little in the area survived.
A turning point came when a crack team of flying screechers
discovered the Zoo in Regent's Park, and most particularly the
reptile house.
Learning a little caution from their previous mistakes in the
petshop, the flying drills and fretsaws brought some of the
larger and fatter iguanas to the giant silver robot, who tried to
conduct high-level talks with them.
Eventually the robot announced to the world that despite the
full, frank and wide-ranging exchange of views the high level
talks had broken down, the lizards had been retired, and that it,
the robot would take a short holiday somewhere, and for some
reason selected Bournemouth.
Ford Prefect, watching it on TV, nodded, laughed, and had another
beer.
Immediate preparations were made for its departure.
The flying toolkits screeched and sawed and drilled and fried
things with light throughout that day and all through the night
time, and in the morning, stunningly, a giant mobile gantry
started to roll westwards on several roads simultaneously with
the robot standing on it, supported within the gantry.
Westward it crawled, like a strange carnival buzzed around by its
servants and helicopters and news coaches, scything through the
land until at last it came to Bournemouth, where the robot slowly
freed itself from it transport system's embraces and went and lay
for ten days on the beach.
It was, of course, by far the most exciting thing that had ever
happened to Bournemouth.
Crowds gathered daily along the perimeter which was staked out
and guarded as the robot's recreation area, and tried to see what
it was doing.
It was doing nothing. It was lying on the beach. It was lying a
little awkwardly on its face.
It was a journalist from a local paper who, late one night,
managed to do what no one else in the world had so far managed,
which was to strike up a brief intelligible conversation with one
of the service robots guarding the perimeter.
It was an extraordinary breakthrough.
"I think there's a story in it," confided the journalist over a
cigarette shared through the steel link fence, "but it needs a
good local angle. I've got a little list of questions here," he
went on, rummaging awkwardly in an inner pocket, "perhaps you
could get him, it, whatever you call him, to run through them
quickly."
The little flying ratchet screwdriver said it would see what it
cold do and screeched off.
A reply was never forthcoming.
Curiously, however, the questions on the piece of paper more or
less exactly matched the questions that were going through the
massive battle-scarred industrial quality circuits of the robot's
mind. They were these:
"How do you feel about being a robot?"
"How does it feel to be from outer space?" and
"How do you like Bournemouth?"
Early the following day things started to be packed up and within
a few days it became apparent that the robot was preparing to
leave for good.
"The point is," said Fenchurch to Ford, "can you get us on
board?"
Ford looked wildly at his watch.
"I have some serious unfinished business to attend to," he
exclaimed.
Crowds thronged as close as they could to the giant silver craft,
which wasn't very. The immediate perimeter was fenced off and
patrolled by the tiny flying service robots. Staked out around
that was the army, who had been completely unable to breach that
inner perimeter, but were damned if anybody was going to breach
them. They in turn were surrounded by a cordon of police, though
whether they were there to protect the public from the army or
the army from the public, or to guarantee the giant ship's
diplomatic immunity and prevent it getting parking tickets was
entirely unclear and the subject of much debate.
The inner perimeter fence was now being dismantled. The army
stirred uncomfortably, uncertain of how to react to the fact that
the reason for their being there seemed as if it was simply going
to get up and go.
The giant robot had lurched back aboard the ship at lunchtime,
and now it was five o'clock in the afternoon and no further sign
had been seen of it. Much had been heard - more grindings and
rumblings from deep within the craft, the music of a million
hideous malfunctions; but the sense of tense expectation among
the crowd was born of the fact that they tensely expected to be
disappointed. This wonderful extraordinary thing had come into
their lives, an now it was simply going to go without them.
Two people were particularly aware of this sensation. Arthur and
Fenchurch scanned the crowd anxiously, unable to find Ford
Prefect in it anywhere, or any sign that he had the slightest
intention of being there.
"How reliable is he?" asked Fenchurch in a sinking voice.
"How reliable?" said Arthur. He gave a hollow laugh. "How shallow
is the ocean?" he said. "How cold is the sun?"
The last parts of the robot's gantry transport were being carried
on board, and the few remaining sections of the perimeter fence
were now stacked at the bottom of the ramp waiting to follow
them. The soldiers on guard round the ramp bristled meaningfully,
orders were barked back and forth, hurried conferences were held,
but nothing, of course, could be done about any of it.
Hopelessly, and with no clear plan now, Arthur and Fenchurch
pushed forward through the crowd, but since the whole crowd was
also trying to push forward through the crowd, this got them
nowhere.
And within a few minutes more nothing remained outside the ship,
every last link of the fence was aboard. A couple of flying fret
saws and a spirit level seemed to do one last check around the
site, and then screamed in through the giant hatchway themselves.
A few seconds passed.
The sounds of mechanical disarray from within changed in
intensity, and slowly, heavily, the huge steel ramp began to lift
itself back out of the Harrods Food Halls. The sound that
accompanied it was the sound of thousands of tense, excited
people being completely ignored.
"Hold it!"
A megaphone barked from a taxi which screeched to a halt on the
edge of the milling crowd.
"There has been," barked the megaphone, "a major scientific
break-in! Through. Breakthrough," it corrected itself. The door
flew open and a small man from somewhere in the vicinity of
Betelgeuse leapt out wearing a white coat.
"Hold it!" he shouted again, and this time brandished a short
squad black rod with lights on it. The lights winked briefly, the
ramp paused in its ascent, and then in obedience to the signals
from the Thumb (which half the electronic engineers in the galaxy
are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming, while the
other half are constantly trying to find fresh ways of jamming
the jamming signals), slowly ground its way downwards again.
Ford Prefect grabbed his megaphone from out of the taxi and
started bawling at the crowd through it.
"Make way," he shouted, "make way, please, this is a major
scientific breakthrough. You and you, get the equipment from the
taxi."
Completely at random he pointed at Arthur and Fenchurch, who
wrestled their way back out of the crowd and clustered urgently
round the taxi.
"All right, I want you to clear a passage, please, for some
important pieces of scientific equipment," boomed Ford. "Just
everybody keep calm. It's all under control, there's nothing to
see. It is merely a major scientific breakthrough. Keep calm now.
Important scientific equipment. Clear the way."
Hungry for new excitement, delighted at this sudden reprieve from
disappointment, the crowd enthusiastically fell back and started
to open up.
Arthur was a little surprised to see what was printed on the
boxes of important scientific equipment in the back of the taxi.
"Hang your coat over them," he muttered to Fenchurch as he heaved
them out to her. Hurriedly he manoeuvred out the large
supermarket trolley that was also jammed against the back seat.
It clattered to the ground, and together they loaded the boxes
into it.
"Clear a path, please," shouted Ford again. "Everything's under
proper scientific control."
"He said you'd pay," said the taxi-driver to Arthur, who dug out
some notes and paid him. There was the distant sound of police
sirens.
"Move along there," shouted Ford, "and no one will get hurt."
The crowd surged and closed behind them again, as frantically
they pushed and hauled the rattling supermarket trolley through
the rubble towards the ramp.
"It's all right," Ford continued to bellow. "There's nothing to
see, it's all over. None of this is actually happening."
"Clear the way, please," boomed a police megaphone from the back
of the crowd. "There's been a break-in, clear the way."
"Breakthrough," yelled Ford in competition. "A scientific
breakthrough!"
"This is the police! Clear the way!"
"Scientific equipment! Clear the way!"
"Police! Let us through!"
"Walkmen!" yelled Ford, and pulled half a dozen miniature tape
players from his pockets and tossed them into the crowd. The
resulting seconds of utter confusion allowed them to get the
supermarket trolley to the edge of the ramp, and to haul it up on
to the lip of it.
"Hold tight," muttered Ford, and released a button on his
Electronic Thumb. Beneath them, the huge ramp juddered and began
slowly to heave its way upwards.
"Ok, kids," he said as the milling crowd dropped away beneath
them and they started to lurch their way along the tilting ramp
into the bowels of the ship, "looks like we're on our way."
Arthur Dent was irritated to be continually wakened by the sound
of gunfire.
Being careful not to wake Fenchurch, who was still managing to
sleep fitfully, he slid his way out of the maintenance hatchway
which they had fashioned into a kind of bunk for themselves,
slung himself down the access ladder and prowled the corridors
moodily.
They were claustrophobic and ill-lit. The lighting circuits
buzzed annoyingly.
This wasn't it, though.
He paused and leaned backwards as a flying power drill flew past
him down the dim corridor with a nasty screech, occasionally
clanging against the walls like a confused bee as it did so.
That wasn't it either.
He clambered through a bulkhead door and found himself in a
larger corridor. Acrid smoke was drifting up from one end so he
walked towards the other.
He came to an observation monitor let into the wall behind a
plate of toughened but still badly scratched perspex.
"Would you turn it down please?" he said to Ford Prefect who was
crouching in front of it in the middle of a pile of bits of video
equipment he'd taken from a shop window in Tottenham Court Road,
having first hurled a small brick through it, and also a nasty
heap of empty beer cans.
"Shhhh!" hissed Ford, and peered with manic concentration at the
screen. He was watching The Magnificent Seven.
"Just a bit," said Arthur.
"No!" shouted Ford. "We're just getting to the good bit! Listen,
I finally got it all sorted out, voltage levels, line conversion,
everything, and this is the good bit!"
With a sigh and a headache, Arthur sat down beside him and
watched the good bit. He listened to Ford's whoops and yells and
"yeehay!"s as placidly as he could.
"Ford," he said eventually, when it was all over, and Ford was
hunting through a stack of cassettes for the tape of Casablanca,
"how come, if ..."
"This is the big one," said Ford. "This is the one I came back
for. Do you realize I never saw it all through? Always I missed
the end. I saw half of it again the night before the Vogons came.
When they blew the place up I thought I'd never get to see it.
Hey, what happened with all that anyway?"
"Just life," said Arthur, and plucked a beer from a six-pack.
"Oh, that again," said Ford. "I thought it might be something
like that. I prefer this stuff," he said as Rick's Bar flickered
on to the screen. "How come if what?"
"What?"
"You started to say, how come if ...'"
"How come if you're so rude about the Earth, that you ... oh
never mind, let's just watch the movie."
"Exactly," said Ford.
There remains little still to tell.
Beyond what used to be known as the Limitless Lightfields of
Flanux until the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine were
discovered lying behind them, lie the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of
Saxaquine. Within the Grey Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine lies the
star named Zarss, around which orbits the planet Preliumtarn in
which is the land of Sevorbeupstry, and it was to the land of
Sevorbeupstry that Arthur and Fenchurch came at last, a little
tired by the journey.
And in the land of Sevorbeupstry, they came to the Great Red
Plain of Rars, which was bounded on the South side by the
Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, on the further side of which,
according to the dying words of Prak, they would find in thirty-
foot-high letters of fire God's Final Message to His Creation.
According to Prak, if Arthur's memory saved him right, the place
was guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob, and so, after a
manner, it proved to be. He was a little man in a strange hat and
he sold them a ticket.
"Keep to the left, please," he said, "keep to the left," and
hurried on past them on a little scooter.
They realized they were not the first to pass that way, for the
path that led around the left of the Great Plain was well-worn
and dotted with booths. At one they bought a box of fudge, which
had been baked in an oven in a cave in the mountain, which was
heated by the fire of the letters that formed God's Final Message
to His Creation. At another they bought some postcards. The
letters had been blurred with an airbrush, "so as not to spoil
the Big Surprise!" it said on the reverse.
"Do you know what the message is?" they asked the wizened little
lady in the booth.
"Oh yes," she piped cheerily, "oh yes!"
She waved them on.
Every twenty miles or so there was a little stone hut with
showers and sanitary facilities, but the going was tough, and the
high sun baked down on the Great Red Plain, and the Great Red
Plain rippled in the heat.
"Is it possible," asked Arthur at one of the larger booths, "to
rent one of those little scooters? Like the one Lajestic
Ventrawhatsit had."
"The scooters," said the little lady who was serving at an ice
cream bar, "are not for the devout."
"Oh well, that's easy then," said Fenchurch, "we're not
particularly devout. We're just interested."
"Then you must turn back now," said the little lady severely, and
when they demurred, sold them a couple of Final Message sunhats
and a photograph of themselves with their arms tight around each
other on the Great Red Plain of Rars.
They drank a couple of sodas in the shade of the booth and then
trudged out into the sun again.
"We're running out of border cream," said Fenchurch after a few
more miles. "We can go to the next booth, or we can return to the
previous one which is nearer, but means we have to retrace our
steps again."
They stared ahead at the distant black speck winking in the heat
haze; they looked behind themselves. They elected to go on.
They then discovered that they were not only not the first ones
to make this journey, but that they were not the only ones making
it now.
Some way ahead of them an awkward low shape was heaving itself
wretchedly along the ground, stumbling painfully slowly, half-
limping, half-crawling.
It was moving so slowly that before too long they caught the
creature up and could see that it was made of worn, scarred and
twisted metal.
It groaned at them as they approached it, collapsing in the hot
dry dust.
"So much time," it groaned, "oh so much time. And pain as well,
so much of that, and so much time to suffer it in too. One or the
other on its own I could probably manage. It's the two together
that really get me down. Oh hello, you again."
"Marvin?" said Arthur sharply, crouching down beside it. "Is that
you?"
"You were always one," groaned the aged husk of the robot, "for
the super-intelligent question, weren't you?"
"What is it?" whispered Fenchurch in alarm, crouching behind
Arthur, and grasping on to his arm. "He's sort of an old friend,"
said Arthur. "I ..."
"Friend!" croaked the robot pathetically. The word died away in a
kind of crackle and flakes of rust fell out of its mouth. "You'll
have to excuse me while I try and remember what the word means.
My memory banks are not what they were you know, and any word
which falls into disuse for a few zillion years has to get
shifted down into auxiliary memory back-up. Ah, here it comes."
The robot's battered head snapped up a bit as if in thought.
"Hmm," he said, "what a curious concept."
He thought a little longer.
"No," he said at last, "don't think I ever came across one of
those. Sorry, can't help you there."
He scraped a knee along pathetically in the dust, an then tried
to twist himself up on his misshapen elbows.
"Is there any last service you would like me to perform for you
perhaps?" he asked in a kind of hollow rattle. "A piece of paper
that perhaps you would like me to pick up for you? Or maybe you
would like me," he continued, "to open a door?"
His head scratched round in its rusty neck bearings and seemed to
scan the distant horizon.
"Don't seem to be any doors around at present," he said, "but I'm
sure that if we waited long enough, someone would build one. And
then," he said slowly twisting his head around to see Arthur
again, "I could open it for you. I'm quite used to waiting you
know."
"Arthur," hissed Fenchurch in his ear sharply, "you never told me
of this. What have you done to this poor creature?"
"Nothing," insisted Arthur sadly, "he's always like this ..."
"Ha!" snapped Marvin. "Ha!" he repeated. "What do you know of
always? You say always' to me, who, because of the silly little
errands your organic lifeforms keep on sending me through time
on, am now thirty-seven times older than the Universe itself?
Pick your words with a little more care," he coughed, "and tact."
He rasped his way through a coughing fit and resumed.
"Leave me," he said, "go on ahead, leave me to struggle painfully
on my way. My time at last has nearly come. My race is nearly
run. I fully expect," he said, feebly waving them on with a
broken finger, "to come in last. It would be fitting. Here I am,
brain the size ..."
Between them they picked him up despite his feeble protests and
insults. The metal was so hot it nearly blistered their fingers,
but he weighed surprisingly little, and hung limply between their
arms.
They carried him with them along the path that ran along the left
of the Great Red Plain of Rars toward the encircling mountains of
Quentulus Quazgar.
Arthur attempted to explain to Fenchurch, but was too often
interrupted by Marvin's dolorous cybernetic ravings.
They tried to see if they could get him some spare parts at one
of the booths, but Marvin would have none of it.
"I'm all spare parts," he droned.
"Let me be!" he groaned.
"Every part of me," he moaned, "has been replaced at least fifty
times ... except ..." He seemed almost imperceptibly to brighten
for a moment. His head bobbed between them with the effort of
memory. "Do you remember, the first time you ever met me," he
said at last to Arthur. "I had been given the intellect-
stretching task of taking you up to the bridge? I mentioned to
you that I had this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left
side? That I had asked for them to be replaced but they never
were?"
He left a longish pause before he continued. They carried him on
between them, under the baking sun that hardly ever seemed to
move, let alone set.
"See if you can guess," said Marvin, when he judged that the
pause had become embarrassing enough, "which parts of me were
never replaced? Go on, see if you can guess.
"Ouch," he added, "ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch."
At last they reached the last of the little booths, set down
Marvin between them and rested in the shade. Fenchurch bought
some cufflinks for Russell, cufflinks that had set in them little
polished pebbles which had been picked up from the Quentulus
Quazgar Mountains, directly underneath the letters of fire in
which was written God's Final Message to His Creation.
Arthur flipped through a little rack of devotional tracts on the
counter, little meditations on the meaning of the Message.
"Ready?" he said to Fenchurch, who nodded.
They heaved up Marvin between them.
They rounded the foot of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains, and
there was the Message written in blazing letters along the crest
of the Mountain. There was a little observation vantage point
with a rail built along the top of a large rock facing it, from
which you could get a good view. It had a little pay-telescope
for looking at the letters in detail, but no one would ever use
it because the letters burned with the divine brilliance of the
heavens and would, if seen through a telescope, have severely
damaged the retina and optic nerve.
They gazed at God's Final Message in wonderment, and were slowly
and ineffably filled with a great sense of peace, and of final
and complete understanding.
Fenchurch sighed. "Yes," she said, "that was it."
They had been staring at it for fully ten minutes before they
became aware that Marvin, hanging between their shoulders, was in
difficulties. The robot could no longer lift his head, had not
read the message. They lifted his head, but he complained that
his vision circuits had almost gone.
They found a coin and helped him to the telescope. He complained
and insulted them, but they helped him look at each individual
letter in turn, The first letter was a "w", the second an "e".
Then there was a gap. An "a" followed, then a "p", an "o" and an
"l".
Marvin paused for a rest.
After a few moments they resumed and let him see the "o", the
"g", the "i", the "s" and the "e".
The next two words were "for" and "the". The last one was a long
one, and Marvin needed another rest before he could tackle it.
It started with an "i", then "n" then a "c". Next came an "o" and
an "n", followed by a "v", an "e", another "n" and an "i".
After a final pause, Marvin gathered his strength for the last
stretch.
He read the "e", the "n", the "c" and at last the final "e", and
staggered back into their arms.
"I think," he murmured at last, from deep within his corroding
rattling thorax, "I feel good about it."
The lights went out in his eyes for absolutely the very last time
ever.
Luckily, there was a stall nearby where you could rent scooters
from guys with green wings.
One of the greatest benefactors of all lifekind was a man who
couldn't keep his mind on the job in hand.
Brilliant?
Certainly.
One of the foremost genetic engineers of his or any other
generation, including a number he had designed himself?
Without a doubt.
The problem was that he was far too interested in things which he
shouldn't be interested in, at least, as people would tell him,
not now.
He was also, partly because of this, of a rather irritable
disposition.
So when his world was threatened by terrible invaders from a
distant star, who were still a fair way off but travelling fast,
he, Blart Versenwald (his name was Blart Versenwald ,
which is not strictly relevant, but quite interesting because -
never mind, that was his name and we can talk about why it's
interesting later), was sent into guarded seclusion by the
masters of his race with instructions to design a breed of
fanatical superwarriors to resist and vanquish the feared
invaders, do it quickly and, they told him, "Concentrate!"
So he sat by a window and looked out at a summer lawn and
designed and designed and designed, but inevitably got a little
distracted by things, and by the time the invaders were
practically in orbit round them, had come up with a remarkable
new breed of super-fly that could, unaided, figure out how to fly
through the open half of a half-open window, and also an off-
switch for children. Celebrations of these remarkable
achievements seemed doomed to be shortlived because disaster was
imminent as the alien ships were landing. But astoundingly, the
fearsome invaders who, like most warlike races were only on the
rampage because they couldn't cope with things at home, were
stunned by Versenwald's extraordinary breakthroughs, joined in
the celebrations and were instantly prevailed upon to sign a
wide-ranging series of trading agreements and set up a programme
of cultural exchanges. And, in an astonishing reversal of normal
practice in the conduct of such matters, everybody concerned
lived happily ever after.
There was a point to this story, but it has temporarily escaped
the chronicler's mind.
 Anything that happens, happens. 
 Anything that, in happening, causes something else to 
 happen, causes something else to happen. 
 Anything that, in happening, causes itself to happen again, 
 happens again. 
 It doesn't necessarily do it in chronological order, though. 
The history of the Galaxy has got a little muddled, for a
number of reasons: partly because those who are trying to keep
track of it have got a little muddled, but also because some very
muddling things have been happening anyway.
One of the problems has to do with the speed of light and
the difficulties involved in trying to exceed it. You can't. Nothing
travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception
of bad news, which obeys its own special laws. The Hingefreel
people of Arkintoofle Minor did try to build spaceships that were
powered by bad news but they didn't work particularly well and
were so extremely unwelcome whenever they arrived anywhere
that there wasn't really any point in being there.
So, by and large, the peoples of the Galaxy tended to languish
in their own local muddles and the history of the Galaxy itself
was, for a long time, largely cosmological.
Which is not to say that people weren't trying. They tried
sending off fleets of spaceships to do battle or business in
distant parts, but these usually took thousands of years to get
anywhere. By the time they eventually arrived, other forms of
travel had been discovered which made use of hyperspace to
circumvent the speed of light, so that whatever battles it was
that the slower-than-light fleets had been sent to fight had already
been taken care of centuries earlier by the time they actually got
there.

This didn't, of course, deter their crews from wanting to fight
the battles anyway. They were trained, they were ready, they'd
had a couple of thousand years' sleep, they'd come a long way
to do a tough job and by Zarquon they were going to do it.

This was when the first major muddles of Galactic history set
in, with battles continually re-erupting centuries after the issues
they had been fought over had supposedly been settled. However,
these muddles were as nothing to the ones which historians had
to try and unravel once time-travel was discovered and battles
started pre-erupting hundreds of years before the issues even
arose. When the Infinite Improbability Drive arrived and whole
planets started turning unexpectedly into banana fruitcake, the
great history faculty of the University of MaxiMegalon finally
gave up, closed itself down and surrendered its buildings to the
rapidly growing joint faculty of Divinity and Water Polo, which
had been after them for years.

Which is all very well, of course, but it almost certainly
means that no one will ever know for sure where, for instance,
the Grebulons came from, or exactly what it was they wanted.
And this is a pity, because if anybody had known anything about
them, it is just possible that a most terrible catastrophe would
have been averted - or at least would have had to find a different
way to happen.
 Click, hum.

The huge grey Grebulon reconnaissance ship moved silently
through the black void. It was travelling at fabulous, breath-
taking speed, yet appeared, against the glimmering background
of a billion distant stars to be moving not at all. It was just one
dark speck frozen against an infinite granularity of brilliant night.

On board the ship, everything was as it had been for millennia,
deeply dark and Silent.

Click, hum.

At least, almost everything.

Click, click, hum.

Click, hum, click, hum, click, hum.

Click, click, click, click, click, hum.

Hmmm.

A low level supervising program woke up a slightly higher
level supervising program deep in the ship's semi-somnolent
cyberbrain and reported to it that whenever it went click all it
got was a hum.

The higher level supervising program asked it what it was
supposed to get, and the low level supervising program said
that it couldn't remember exactly, but thought it was probably
more of a sort of distant satisfied sigh, wasn't it? It didn't know
what this hum was. Click, hum, click, hum. That was all it was
getting.

The higher level supervising program considered this and
didn't like it. It asked the low level supervising program what
exactly it was supervising and the low level supervising program
said it couldn't remember that either, just that it was something
that was meant to go click, sigh every ten years or so, which
usually happened without fail. It had tried to consult its error
look-up table but couldn't find it, which was why it had alerted
the higher level supervising program to the problem .

The higher level supervising program went to consult one of
its own look-up tables to find out what the low level supervising
program was meant to be supervising.

It couldn't find the look-up table .

Odd.

It looked again. All it got was an error message. It tried
to look up the error message in its error message look-up table
and couldn't find that either. It allowed a couple of nanoseconds
to go by while it went through all this again. Then it woke up its
sector function supervisor.

The sector function supervisor hit immediate problems. It
called its supervising agent which hit problems too. Within a few
millionths of a second virtual circuits that had lain dormant, some
for years, some for centuries, were flaring into life throughout the
ship. Something, somewhere, had gone terribly wrong, but none
of the supervising programs could tell what it was. At every level,
vital instructions were missing, and the instructions about what to
do in the event of discovering that vital instructions were missing,
were also missing.

Small modules of software - agents - surged through the
logical pathways, grouping, consulting, re-grouping. They quickly
established that the ship's memory, all the way back to its central
mission module, was in tatters. No amount of interrogation could
determine what it was that had happened. Even the central mis-
sion module itself seemed to be damaged.

This made the whole problem very simple to deal with.
Replace the central mission module. There was another one,
a backup, an exact duplicate of the original. It had to be
physically replaced because, for safety reasons, there was no
link whatsoever between the original and its backup. Once the
central mission module was replaced it could itself supervise the
reconstruction of the rest of the system in every detail, and all
would be well.

Robots were instructed to bring the backup central mission
module from the shielded strong room, where they guarded it,
to the ship's logic chamber for installation.

This involved the lengthy exchange of emergency codes and
protocols as the robots interrogated the agents as to the authen-
ticity of the instructions. At last the robots were satisfied that
all procedures were correct. They unpacked the backup central
mission module from its storage housing, carried it out of the
storage chamber, fell out of the ship and went spinning off into
the void.

This provided the first major clue as to what it was that
was wrong.

Further investigation quickly established what it was that had
happened. A meteorite had knocked a large hole in the ship. The
ship had not previously detected this because the meteorite had
neatly knocked out that part of the ship's processing equipment
which was supposed to detect if the ship had been hit by a
meteorite.
 The first thing to do was to try to seal up the hole. This turned
out to be impossible, because the ship's sensors couldn't see that
there was a hole, and the supervisors which should have said that
the sensors weren't working properly weren't working properly
and kept saying that the sensors were fine. The ship could only
deduce the existence of the hole from the fact that the robots
had clearly fallen out of it, taking its spare brain, which would
have enabled it to see the hole, with them.

The ship tried to think intelligently about this, failed, and then
blanked out completely for a bit. It didn't realise it had blanked
out, of course, because it had blanked out. It was merely surprised
to see the stars jump. After the third time the stars jumped the
ship finally realised that it must be blanking out, and that it was
time to take some serious decisions.

It relaxed.

Then it realised it hadn't actually taken the serious decisions
yet and panicked. It blanked out again for a bit. When it awoke
again it sealed all the bulkheads around where it knew the unseen
hole must be.

It clearly hadn't got to its destination yet, it thought, fitfully,
but since it no longer had the faintest idea where its destina-
tion was or how to reach it, there seemed to be little point
in continuing. It consulted what tiny scraps of instructions it
could reconstruct from the tatters of its central mission mod-
ule.

Your !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! year mission is to !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!!,
!!!!! !!!!! !!!!! !!!!!, land !!!!! !!!!! !!!!! a safe distance !!!!! !!!!!
..... ..... ..... .... , land ..... ..... ..... 
monitor it. !!!!! !!!!! !!!!!...'

All of the rest was complete garbage.

Before it blanked out for good the ship would have to pass
on those instructions, such as they were, to its more primitive
subsidiary systems.

It must also revive all of its crew.

There was another problem. While the crew was in hibernation,
the minds of all of its members, their memories, their identities
and their understanding of what they had come to do, had all
been transferred into the ship's central mission module for safe
keeping. The crew would not have the faintest idea of who they
were or what they were doing there. Oh well.

Just before it blanked out for the final time, the ship realised
that its engines were beginning to give out too.

The ship and its revived and confused crew coasted on under
the control of its subsidiary automatic systems, which simply
looked to land wherever they could find to land and monitor
whatever they could find to monitor.

As far as finding something to land on was concerned, they
didn't do very well. The planet they found was desolately cold
and lonely, so achingly far from the sun that should warm it, that
it took all of the Envir-O-Form machinery and LifeSupport-O-
Systems they carried with them to render it, or at least enough
parts of it, habitable. There were better planets nearer in, but
the ship's Strateej-O-Mat was obviously locked into Lurk mode
and chose the most distant and unobtrusive planet and, further-
more, would not be gainsaid by anybody other than the ship's
Chief Strategic Officer. Since everybody on the ship had lost
their minds no one knew who the Chief Strategic Officer was
or, even if he could have been identified, how he was supposed
to go about gainsaying the ship's Strateej-O-Mat.

As far as finding something to monitor was concerned, though,
they hit solid gold.

One of the extraordinary things about life is the sort of places
it's prepared to put up with living. Anywhere it can get some
kind of a grip, whether it's the intoxicating seas of Santraginus
V, where the fish never seem to care whatever the heck kind
of direction they swim in, the fire storms of Frastra where, they
say, life begins at , degrees, or just burrowing around in
the lower intestine of a rat for the sheer unadulterated hell of
it, life will always find a way of hanging on in somewhere.

It will even live in New York, though it's hard to know why.
In the winter time the temperature falls well below the legal
minimum, or rather it would do if anybody had the common
sense to set a legal minimum. The last time anybody made a
list of the top hundred character attributes of New Yorkers,
common sense snuck in at number .

In the summer it's too darn hot. It's one thing to be the sort
of life form that thrives on heat and finds, as the Frastrans do,
that the temperature range between , and , is very
equable, but it's quite another to be the sort of animal that has
to wrap itself up in lots of other animals at one point in your
planet's orbit, and then find, half an orbit later, that your skin's
bubbling.

Spring is over-rated. A lot of the inhabitants of New York
will honk on mightily about the pleasures of spring, but if they
actually knew the first thing about the pleasures of spring they
would know of at least five thousand nine hundred and eighty-
three better places to spend it than New York, and that's just
on the same latitude.

Fall, though, is the worst. Few things are worse than fall in
New York. Some of the things that live in the lower intestines of
rats would disagree, but most of the things that live in the lower
intestines of rats are highly disagreeable anyway, so their opinion
can and should be discounted. When it's fall in New York, the air
smells as if someone's been frying goats in it, and if you are keen
to breathe, the best plan is to open a window and stick your head
in a building.

Tricia McMillan loved New York. She kept on telling herself
this over and over again. The Upper West Side. Yeah. Mid Town.
Hey, great retail. SoHo. The East Village. Clothes. Books. Sushi.
Italian. Delis. Yo. 

Movies. Yo also. Tricia had just been to see Woody Allen's
new movie which was all about the angst of being neurotic in New
York. He had made one or two other movies that had explored
the same theme, and Tricia wondered if he had ever considered
moving, but heard that he had set his face against the idea. So:
more movies, she guessed.

Tricia loved New York because loving New York was a good
career move. It was a good retail move, a good cuisine move,
not a good taxi move or a great quality of pavement move, but
definitely a career move that ranked amongst the highest and the
best. Tricia was a TV anchor person, and New York was where
most of the world's TV was anchored. Tricia's TV anchoring had
been done exclusively in Britain up to that point: regional news,
then breakfast news, early evening news. She would have been
called, if the language allowed, a rapidly rising anchor, but...
hey, this is television, what does it matter? She was a rapidly rising
anchor. She had what it took: great hair, a profound understand-
ing of strategic lip gloss, the intelligence to understand the world
and a tiny secret interior deadness which meant she didn't care.
Everybody has their moment of great opportunity in life. If you
happen to miss the one you care about, then everything else in
life becomes eerily easy.

Tricia had only ever missed one opportunity. These days it
didn't even make her tremble quite so much as it used to to
think about it. She guessed it was that bit of her that had gone
dead.

NBS needed a new anchor. Mo Minetti was leaving the
US AM breakfast show to have a baby. She had been offered a
mind-bubbling amount of money to have it on the show, but she
had declined, unexpectedly, on grounds of personal privacy and
taste. Teams of NBS lawyers had sieved through her contract to
see if these constituted legitimate grounds, but in the end, reluc-
tantly, they had to let her go. This was, for them, particularly
galling because normally reluctantly letting someone go' was an
expression that had its boot on quite another foot.

The word was out that maybe, just maybe, a British accent
would fit. The hair, the skin tone and the bridgework would have
to be up to American network standards, but there had been a
lot of British accents up there thanking their mothers for their
Oscars, a lot of British accents singing on Broadway, and some
unusually big audiences tuning in to British accents in wigs on
Masterpiece Theatre. British accents were telling jokes on David
Letterman and Jay Leno. Nobody understood the jokes but they
were really responding to the accents, so maybe it was time, just
maybe. A British accent on US AM. Well, hell.

That was why Tricia was here. This was why loving New
York was a great career move.

It wasn't, of course, the stated reason. Her TV company
back in the UK would hardly have stumped up the air fare
and hotel bill for her to go job hunting in Manhattan. Since
she was chasing something like ten times her present salary, they
might have felt that she could have forked out her own expenses,
but she'd found a story, found a pretext, kept very quiet about
anything ulterior, and they'd stumped up for the trip. A business
class ticket, of course, but her face was known and she'd smiled
herself an upgrade. The right moves had got her a nice room at
the Brentwood and here she was, wondering what to do next.

The word on the street was one thing, making contact was
another. She had a couple of names, a couple of numbers, but all
it took was being put on indeterminate hold a couple of times and
she was back at square one. She'd put out feelers, left messages,
but so far none had been returned. The actual job she had come
to do she had done in a morning; the imagined job she was after
was only shimmering tantalisingly on an unreachable horizon.

Shit.

She caught a cab from the movie theatre back to the Brent-
wood. The cab couldn't get close to the kerb because a big stretch
limo was hogging all the available space and she had to squeeze
her way past it. She walked out of the fetid, goat-frying air and
into the blessed cool of the lobby. The fine cotton of her blouse
was sticking like grime to her skin. Her hair felt as if she'd bought
it at a fairground on a stick. At the front desk she asked if there
were any messages, grimly expecting none. There was one.

Oh...

Good.

It had worked. She had gone out to the movie specifically
in order to make the phone ring. She couldn't bear sitting in
a hotel room waiting.

She wondered. Should she open the message down here?
Her clothes were itching and she longed to take them all off
and just lie on the bed. She had turned the air conditioning way
down to its bottom temperature setting, way up to its top fan
setting. What she wanted more than anything else in the world
at the moment was goose pimples. Then a hot shower, then a
cool one, then lying on a towel, on the bed again, drying in the
air conditioning. Then reading the message. Maybe more goose
pimples. Maybe all sorts of things.

No. What she wanted more than anything else in the world
was a job in American television at ten times her current salary.
More than anything else in the world. In the world. What she
wanted more than anything else at all was no longer a live issue.

She sat on a chair in the lobby, under a kentia palm, and
opened the little cellophane-windowed envelope.

Please call,' it said. Not happy,' and gave a number. The
name was Gail Andrews.

Gail Andrews.

It wasn't a name she was expecting. It caught her unawares.
She recognised it, but couldn't immediately say why. Was she
Andy Martin's secretary? Hilary Bass's assistant? Martin and
Bass were the two major contact calls she had made, or tried
to make, at NBS. And what did Not happy' mean?

Not happy?'

She was completely bewildered. Was this Woody Allen trying
to contact her under an assumed name? It was a area code
number. So it was someone in New York. Who was not happy.
Well, that narrowed it down a bit, didn't it?

She went back to the receptionist at the desk.

I have a problem with this message you just gave me,' she
said. Someone I don't know has tried to call me and says she's
not happy.'

The receptionist peered at the note with a frown.

Do you know this person?' he said.

No,' Tricia said.

Hmmm,' said the receptionist. Sounds like she's not happy
about something.'

Yes,' said Tricia.

Looks like there's a name here,' said the receptionist. Gail
Andrews. Do you know anybody of that name?'

No,' said Tricia.

Any idea what she's unhappy about?'

No,' said Tricia.

Have you called the number? There's a number here.'

No,' said Tricia, you only just gave me the note. I'm just
trying to get some more information before I ring back. Perhaps
I could talk to the person who took the call?'

Hmmm,' said the receptionist, scrutinising the note carefully.
I don't think we have anybody called Gail Andrews here.'

No, I realise that,' said Tricia. I just -'

I'm Gail Andrews.'

The voice came from behind Tricia. She turned round.

I'm sorry?'

I'm Gail Andrews. You interviewed me this morning.'

Oh. Oh good heavens yes,' said Tricia, slightly flustered.

I Left the message for you a few hours ago. I hadn't heard
so I came by. I didn't want to miss you.'

Oh. No. Of course,' said Tricia, trying hard to get up to speed.

I don't know about this,' said the receptionist, for whom
speed was not an issue. Would you like me to try this number
for you now?'

No, that'll be fine, thanks,' said Tricia. I can handle it now.'

I can call this room number here for you if that'll help,'
said the receptionist, peering at the note again.

No, that won't be necessary, thanks,' said Tricia. That's
my own room number. I'm the one the message was for. I
think we've sorted this out now.'

You have a nice day now,' said the receptionist.

Tricia didn't particularly want to have a nice day. She was busy.

She also didn't want to talk to Gail Andrews. She had a very
strict cut-off point as far as fraternising with the Christians was
concerned. Her colleagues called her interview subjects Chris-
tians and would often cross themselves when they saw one
walking innocently into the studio to face Tricia, particularly
if Tricia was smiling warmly and showing her teeth.

She turned and smiled frostily, wondering what to do.

Gail Andrews was a well groomed woman in her mid-forties.
Her clothes fell within the boundaries defined by expensive good
taste, but were definitely huddled up at the floatier end of those
boundaries. She was an astrologer - a famous and, if rumour were
true, influential astrologer, having allegedly influenced a number
of decisions made by the late President Hudson, including every-
thing from which flavour of cream whip to have on which day of
the week, to whether or not to bomb Damascus.

Tricia had savaged her more than somewhat. Not on the
grounds of whether or not the stories about the President were
true, that was old hat now. At the time Ms Andrews had emphati-
cally denied advising President Hudson on anything other than
personal, spiritual or dietary matters, which did not, apparently
include the bombing of Damascus. (NOTHING PERSONAL,
DAMASCUS!' the tabloids had hooted at the time.)

No, this was a neat topical little angle that Tricia had come
up with about the whole issue of astrology itself. Ms Andrews
had not been entirely ready for it. Tricia, on the other hand,
was not entirely ready for a re-match in the hotel lobby. What
to do?

I can wait for you in the bar, if you need a few minutes,'
said Gail Andrews. But I would like to talk to you, and I'm
leaving the city tonight.'

She seemed to be slightly anxious about something rather
than aggrieved or irate.

OK,' said Tricia. Give me ten minutes.'

She went up to her room. Apart from anything else, she
had so little faith in the ability of the guy on the message desk
at reception to deal with anything as complicated as a message
that she wanted to be doubly certain that there wasn't a note
under the door. It wouldn't be the first time that messages at
the desk and messages under the door had been completely at
odds with each other.

There wasn't one.

The message light on the phone was flashing though.

She hit the message button and got the hotel operator.

You have a message from Gary Andress,' said the operator.

Yes?' said Tricia. An unfamiliar name. What does it say.'

Not hippy,' said the operator.

Not what?' said Tricia.

Hippy. What it says. Guy says he's not a hippy. I guess
he wanted you to know that. You want the number?'

As she started to dictate the number Tricia suddenly realised
that this was just a garbled version of the message she had already
had.

OK, OK,' she said. Are there any other messages for me?'

Room number?'

Tricia couldn't work out why the operator should suddenly
ask for her number this late in the conversation, but gave it
to her anyway.

Name?'

McMillan, Tricia McMillan.' Tricia spelt it, patiently.

Not Mr MacManus?'

No.'

No more messages for you.' Click.

Tricia sighed and dialled again. This time she gave her name
and room number all over again, up front. The operator showed
not the slightest glimmer of recognition that they had been speak-
ing less than ten seconds ago.

I'm going to be in the bar,' Tricia explained. In the bar.
If a phone call comes through for me, please would you put
it through to me in the bar?'

Name?'

They went through it all a couple more times till Tricia was
certain that everything that possibly could be clear was as clear
as it possibly could be.

She showered, put on fresh clothes and retouched her makeup
with the speed of a professional, and, looking at her bed with a
sigh, left the room again.

She had half a mind just to sneak off and hide.

No. Not really.

She had a look at herself in the mirror in the elevator lobby
while she was waiting. She looked cool and in charge, and if she
could fool herself she could fool anybody.

She was just going to have to tough it out with Gail Andrews.
OK, she had given her a hard time. Sorry but that's the game
we're all in - that sort of thing. Ms Andrews had agreed to do
the interview because she had a new book out and TV exposure
was free publicity. But there's no such thing as a free launch.
No, she edited that line out again.

What had happened was this:

Last week astronomers had announced that they had at last
discovered a tenth planet, out beyond the orbit of Pluto. They
had been searching for it for years, guided by certain orbital
anomalies in the outer planets, and now they'd found it and they
were all terribly pleased, and everyone was terribly happy for
them and so on. The planet was named Persephone, but rapidly
nicknamed Rupert after some astronomer's parrot - there was
some tediously heart-warming story attached to this - and that
was all very wonderful and lovely.

Tricia had followed the story with, for various reasons, con-
siderable interest.

Then, while she had been casting around for a good excuse to
go to New York at her TV company's expense she had happened
to notice a press release about Gail Andrews, and her new book,
You and Your Planets.

Gail Andrews was not exactly a household name, but the
moment you mentioned President Hudson, cream whips and the
amputation of Damascus (the world had moved on from surgi-
cal strikes. The official term had in fact been Damascectomy',
meaning the taking out' of Damascus), everyone remembered
who you meant.

Tricia saw an angle here which she quickly sold to her producer.

Surely the notion that great lumps of rock whirling in space
knew something about your day that you didn't must take a bit
of a knock from the fact that there was suddenly a new lump of
rock out there that nobody had known about before.

That must throw a few calculations out, mustn't it?

What about all those star charts and planetary motions and
so? We all knew (apparently) what happened when Neptune
was in Virgo, and so on, but what about when Rupert was
rising? Wouldn't the whole of astrology have to be rethought?
Wouldn't now perhaps be a good time to own up that it was
all just a load of hogwash and instead take up pig-farming, the
principles of which were founded on some kind of rational basis?
If we'd known about Rupert three years ago, might President
Hudson have been eating the boysenberry flavour on Thursday
rather than Friday? Might Damascus still be standing? That sort
of thing.

Gail Andrews had taken it all reasonably well. She was
just starting to recover from the initial onslaught, when she
made the rather serious mistake of trying to shake Tricia off by
talking smoothly about diurnal arcs, right ascensions and some
of the more abstruse areas of three-dimensional trigonometry.

To her shock she discovered that everything she delivered to
Tricia came right back at her with more spin on it than she could
cope with. Nobody had warned Gail that being a TV bimbo was,
for Tricia, her second stab at a role in life. Behind her Chanel lip
gloss, her coupe sauvage and her crystal blue contact lenses lay a
brain that had acquired for itself, in an earlier, abandoned phase
of her life, a first class degree in mathematics and a doctorate in
astrophysics.
 As she was getting into the elevator Tricia, slightly preoccupied,
realised she had left her bag in her room and wondered whether
to duck back out and get it. No. It was probably safer where it
was and there wasn't anything she particularly needed in it. She
let the door close behind her.

Besides, she told herself, taking a deep breath, if life had
taught her anything it was this:

Never go back for your bag.

As the elevator went down she stared up at the ceiling in
a rather intent way. Anyone who didn't know Tricia McMillan
better would have said that that was exactly the way people
sometimes stared upwards when they were trying to hold back
tears. She must have been staring at the tiny security video camera
mounted up in the corner.
 She marched rather briskly out of the elevator a minute later,
and went up to the reception desk again.

Now, I'm going to write this out,' she said, because I
don't want anything to go wrong.'

She wrote her name in large letters on a piece of paper,
then her room number, then IN THE BAR' and gave it to
the receptionist, who looked at it.

That's in case there's a message for me. OK?'

The receptionist continued to look at it.

You want me to see if she's in her room?' he said.
 Two minutes later, Tricia swivelled into the bar seat next to
Gail Andrews, who was sitting in front of a glass of white wine.

You struck me as the sort of person who preferred to sit
up at the bar rather than demurely at a table,' she said.

This was true, and caught Tricia a little by surprise.

Vodka?' said Gail.

Yes,' said Tricia, suspiciously. She just stopped herself asking,
How did you know?' but Gail answered anyway.

I asked the barman,' she said, with a kindly smile.

The barman had her vodka ready for her and slid it charmingly
across the glossy mahogany.

Thank you,' said Tricia, stirring it sharply.

She didn't know quite what to make out of all this sudden
niceness and was determined not to be wrong-footed by it. People
in New York were not nice to each other without reason.

Ms Andrews,' she said, firmly, I'm sorry that you're not
happy. I know you probably feel I was a bit rough with you this
morning, but astrology is, after all, just popular entertainment,
which is fine. It's part of showbiz and it's a part that you have
done well out of and good luck to you. It's fun. It's not a science
though, and it shouldn't be mistaken for one. I think that's some-
thing we both managed to demonstrate very successfully together
this morning, while at the same time generating some popular
entertainment, which is what we both do for a living. I'm sorry
if you have a problem with that.'

I'm perfectly happy,' said Gail Andrews.

Oh,' said Tricia, not quite certain what to make of this.
It said in your message that you were not happy.'

No,' said Gail Andrews. I said in my message that I thought
you were not happy, and I was just wondering why.'

Tricia felt as if she had been kicked in the back of the
head. She blinked.

What?' she said quietly.

To do with the stars. You seemed very angry and unhappy
about something to do with stars and planets when we were
having our discussion, and it's been bothering me, which is why
I came to see if you were all right.'

Tricia stared at her. Ms Andrews - ' she started, and then
realised that the way she had said it sounded exactly angry and
unhappy and rather undermined the protest she had been trying
to make.

Please call me Gail, if that's OK.'

Tricia just looked bewildered.

I know that astrology isn't a science,' said Gail. Of course
it isn't. It's just an arbitrary set of rules like chess or tennis or,
what's that strange thing you British play?'

Er, cricket? Self-loathing?'

Parliamentary democracy. The rules just kind of got there.
They don't make any kind of sense except in terms of them-
selves. But when you start to exercise those rules, all sorts of
processes start to happen and you start to find out all sorts of
stuff about people. In astrology the rules happen to be about
stars and planets, but they could be about ducks and drakes for
all the difference it would make. It's just a way of thinking about
a problem which lets the shape of that problem begin to emerge.
The more rules, the tinier the rules, the more arbitrary they are,
the better. It's like throwing a handful of fine graphite dust on a
piece of paper to see where the hidden indentations are. It lets
you see the words that were written on the piece of paper above
it that's now been taken away and hidden. The graphite's not
important. It's just the means of revealing their indentations. So
you see, astrology's nothing to do with astronomy. It's just to do
with people thinking about people.

So when you got so, I don't know, so emotionally focused
on stars and planets this morning, I began to think, she's not
angry about astrology, she really is angry and unhappy about
actual stars and planets. People usually only get that unhappy
and angry when they've lost something. That's all I could think
and I couldn't make any more sense of it than that. So I came
to see if you were OK.'

Tricia was stunned.

One part of her brain had already got started on all sorts
of stuff. It was busy constructing all sorts of rebuttals to do
with how ridiculous newspaper horoscopes were and the sort of
statistical tricks they played on people. But gradually it petered
out, because it realised that the rest of her brain wasn't listening.
She had been completely stunned.

She had just been told, by a total stranger, something she'd
kept completely secret for seventeen years.

She turned to look at Gail.

I...'

She stopped.

A tiny security camera up behind the bar had turned to
follow her movement. This completely flummoxed her. Most
people would not have noticed it. It was not designed to be
noticed. It was not designed to suggest that nowadays even an
expensive and elegant hotel in New York couldn't be sure that
its clientele wasn't suddenly going to pull a gun or not wear a tie.
But carefully hidden though it was behind the vodka, it couldn't
deceive the finely honed instinct of a TV anchor person, which
was to know exactly when a camera was turning to look at her.

Is something wrong?' asked Gail.

No, I... I have to say that you've rather astonished me,'
said Tricia. She decided to ignore the security camera. It was
just her imagination playing tricks with her because she had
television so much on her mind today. It wasn't the first time it
had happened. A traffic monitoring camera, she was convinced,
had swung round to follow her as she walked past it, and a secu-
rity camera in Bloomingdales had seemed to make a particular
point of watching her trying on hats. She was obviously going
dotty. She had even imagined that a bird in Central Park had
been peering at her rather intently.

She decided to put it out of her mind and took a sip of
her vodka. Someone was walking round the bar asking people
if they were Mr MacManus.

OK,' she said, suddenly blurting it out. I don't know how
you worked it out, but...'

I didn't work it out, as you put it. I just listened to what
you were saying.'

What I lost, I think, was a whole other life.'

Everybody does that. Every moment of every day. Every
single decision we make, every breath we draw, opens some
doors and closes many others. Most of them we don't notice.
Some we do. Sounds like you noticed one.'

Oh yes, I noticed,' said Tricia. All right. Here it is. It's
very simple. Many years ago I met a guy at a party. He said he
was from another planet and did I want to go along with him. I
said, yes, OK. It was that kind of party. I said to him to wait
while I went to get my bag and then I'd be happy to go off to
another planet with him. He said I wouldn't need my bag. I said
he obviously came from a very backward planet or he'd know
that a woman always needed to take her bag with her. He got a
bit impatient, but I wasn't gong to be a complete pushover just
because he said he was from another planet.

I went upstairs. Took me a while to find my bag, and then
there was someone else in the bathroom. Came down and he
was gone.'

Tricia paused.

And...?' said Gail.

The garden door was open. I went outside. There were
lights. Some kind of gleaming thing. I was just in time to see
it rise up into the sky, shoot silently up through the clouds and
disappear. That was it. End of story. End of one life, beginning
of another. But hardly a moment of this life goes by that I don't
wonder about some other me. A me that didn't go back for her
bag. I feel like she's out there somewhere and I'm walking in
her shadow.'

A member of the hotel staff was now going round the bar
asking people if they were Mr Miller. Nobody was.

You really think this... person was from another planet?'
asked Gail.

Oh, certainly. There was the spacecraft. Oh, and also he
had two heads.'

Two? Didn't anybody else notice?'

It was a fancy dress party.'

I see...'

And he had a bird cage over it, of course. With a cloth over
the cage. Pretended he had a parrot. He tapped on the cage and
it did a lot of stupid Pretty Polly'' stuff and squawking and so
on. Then he pulled the cloth back for a moment and roared with
laughter. There was another head in there, laughing along with
him. It was a worrying moment I can tell you.'

I think you probably did the right thing, dear, don't you?'
said Gail.

No,' said Tricia. No I don't. And I couldn't carry on doing
what I was doing either. I was an astrophysicist, you see. You
can't be an astrophysicist properly if you've actually met someone
from another planet who's got a second head that pretends to be
a parrot. You just can't do it. I couldn't at least.'

I can see it would be hard. And that's probably why you
tend to be a little hard on other people who talk what sounds
like complete nonsense.'

Yes,' said Tricia. I expect you're right. I'm sorry.'

That's OK.'

You're the first person I've ever told this, by the way.'

I wondered. You married?'

Er, no. So hard to tell these days isn't it? But you're right
to ask because that was probably the reason. I came very close
a few times, mostly because I wanted to have a kid. But every guy
ended up asking why I was constantly looking over his shoulder.
What do you tell someone? At one point I even thought I might
just go to a sperm bank and take pot luck. Have somebody's child
at random.'

You can't seriously do that, can you?'

Tricia laughed. Probably not. I never quite went and found
out for real. Never quite did it. Story of my life. Never quite
did the real thing. That's why I'm in television I guess. Nothing
is real.'

Excuse me lady, your name Tricia McMillan?'

Tricia looked round in surprise. There was a man standing
there in a chauffeur's hat.

Yes,' she said, instantly pulling herself back together again.

Lady, I been looking for you for about an hour. Hotel said
they didn't have anybody of that name, but I checked back with
Mr Martin's office and they said that this was definitely where
you staying. So I ask again, they still say they never heard of
you, so I get them to page you anyway and they can't find you.
In the end I get the office to FAX a picture of you through to
the car and have a look myself.'

He looked at his watch.

May be a bit late now, but do you want to go anyway?'

Tricia was stunned.

Mr Martin? You mean Andy Martin at NBS?'

That's correct, lady. Screen test for US AM.'

Tricia shot up out of her seat. She couldn't even bear to
think of all the messages she'd heard for Mr MacManus and
Mr Miller.

Only we have to hurry,' said the chauffeur. As I heard it Mr
Martin thinks it might be worth trying a British accent. His boss
at the network is dead against the idea. That's Mr Zwingler, and
I happen to know he's flying out to the coast this evening because
I'm the one has to pick him up and take him to the airport.'

OK,' said Tricia, I'm ready. Let's go.'

OK, lady. It's the big limo out the front.'

Tricia turned back to Gail. I'm sorry,' she said.

Go! Go!' said Gail. And good luck. I've enjoyed meeting
you.'

Tricia made to reach for her bag for some cash.

Damn,' she said. She'd left it upstairs.

Drinks are on me,' insisted Gail. Really. It's been very
interesting.'

Tricia sighed.

Look, I'm really sorry about this morning and...'

Don't say another word. I'm fine. It's only astrology. It's
harmless. It's not the end of the world.'

Thanks.' On an impulse Tricia gave her a hug.

You got everything?' said the chauffeur. You don't want
to pick up your bag or anything?'

If there's one thing that life's taught me,' said Tricia, it's
never go back for your bag.'
 Just a little over an hour later, Tricia sat on one of the pair of
beds in her hotel room. For a few minutes she didn't move. She
just stared at her bag, which was sitting innocently on top of the
other bed.

In her hand was a note from Gail Andrews, saying, Don't
be too disappointed. Do ring if you want to talk about it. If I
were you I'd stay in at home tomorrow night. Get some rest.
But don't mind me, and don't worry. It's only astrology. It's not
the end of the world. Gail.'

The chauffeur had been dead right. In fact the chauffeur
seemed to know more about what was going on inside NBS than
any other single person she had encountered in the organisation.
Martin had been keen, Zwingler had not. She had had her one
shot at proving Martin right and she had blown it.

Oh well. Oh well, oh well, oh well.

Time to go home. Time to phone the airline and see if
she could still get the red-eye back to Heathrow. tonight. She
reached for the big phone directory.

Oh. First things first.

She put down the directory again, picked up her handbag,
and took it through to the bathroom. She put it down and took
out the small plastic case which held her contact lenses, without
which she had been unable properly to read either the script or
the autocue.

As she dabbed each tiny plastic cup into her eyes she reflected
that if there was one thing life had taught her it was that there
are times when you do not go back for your bag and other times
when you do. It had yet to teach her to distinguish between the
two types of occasion.

The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has, in what we laughingly
call the past, had a great deal to say on the subject of parallel
universes. Very little of this is, however, at all comprehensible
to anyone below the level of Advanced God, and since it is
now well-established that all known gods came into existence
a good three millionths of a second after the Universe began
rather than, as they usually claimed, the previous week, they
already have a great deal of explaining to do as it is, and are
therefore not available for comment on matters of deep physics
at this time.

One encouraging thing the Guide does have to say on the
subject of parallel universes is that you don't stand the remotest
chance of understanding it. You can therefore say What?' and
Eh?' and even go cross-eyed and start to blither if you like
without any fear of making a fool of yourself.

The first thing to realise about parallel universes, the Guide
says, is that they are not parallel.

It is also important to realise that they are not, strictly speaking,
universes either, but it is easiest if you try and realise that a little
later, after you've realised that everything you've realised up to
that moment is not true.

The reason they are not universes is that any given universe
is not actually a thing as such, but is just a way of looking at
what is technically known as the WSOGMM, or Whole Sort of
General Mish Mash. The Whole Sort of General Mish Mash
doesn't actually exist either, but is just the sum total of all the
different ways there would be of looking at it if it did.

The reason they are not parallel is the same reason that the
sea is not parallel. It doesn't mean anything. You can slice the
Whole Sort of General Mish Mash any way you like and you will
generally come up with something that someone will call home.

Please feel free to blither now.
 The Earth with which we are here concerned, because of its
particular orientation in the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash,
was hit by a neutrino that other Earths were not.

A neutrino is not a big thing to be hit by.

In fact it's hard to think of anything much smaller by which
one could reasonably hope to be hit. And it's not as if being
hit by neutrinos was in itself a particularly unusual event for
something the size of the Earth. Far from it. It would be an
unusual nanosecond in which the Earth was not hit by several
billion passing neutrinos.

It all depends on what you mean by hit', of course, seeing as
matter consists almost entirely of nothing at all. The chances of
a neutrino actually hitting something as it travels through all this
howling emptiness are roughly comparable to that of dropping a
ball bearing at random from a cruising and hitting, say, an
egg sandwich.

Anyway, this neutrino hit something. Nothing terribly impor-
tant in the scale of things, you might say. But the problem with
saying something like that is that you would be talking cross-
eyed badger spit. Once something actually happens somewhere
in something as wildly complicated as the Universe, Kevin knows
where it will all end up - where Kevin' is any random entity that
doesn't know nothin' about nothin'.

This neutrino struck an atom.

The atom was part of a molecule. The molecule was part
of a nucleic acid. The nucleic acid was part of a gene. The
gene was part of a genetic recipe for growing... and so on.
The upshot was that a plant ended up growing an extra leaf. In
Essex. Or what would, after a lot of palaver and local difficulties
of a geological nature, become Essex.

The plant was a clover. It threw its weight, or rather its seed,
around extremely effectively and rapidly became the world's
dominant type of clover. The precise causal connection between
this tiny biological happenstance, and a few other minor vari-
ations that exist in that slice of the Whole Sort of General
Mish Mash - such as Tricia McMillan failing to leave with
Zaphod Beeblebrox, abnormally low sales of pecan-flavoured
ice-cream and the fact that the Earth On which all this occurred
did not get demolished by the Vogons to make way for a new
hyperspace bypass - is currently sitting at number ,,,
on the research project priority list at what was once the History
Department of the University of MaxiMegalon, and no one cur-
rently at the prayer meeting by the poolside appears to feel any
sense of urgency about the problem.

Tricia began to feel that the world was conspiring against her.
She knew that this was a perfectly normal way to feel after an
overnight flight going east, when you suddenly have a whole
other mysteriously threatening day to deal with for which you
are not the least bit prepared. But still.

There were marks on her lawn.

She didn't really care about marks on her lawn very much.
Marks on her lawn could go and take a running jump as far as
she was concerned. It was Saturday morning. She had just got
home from New York feeling tired, crabby and paranoid, and
all she wanted to do was go to bed with the radio on quietly and
gradually fall asleep to the sound of Ned Sherrin being terribly
clever about something.

But Eric Bartlett was not going to let her get away with not
making a thorough inspection of the marks. Eric was the old
gardener who came in from the village on Saturday mornings
to poke around at her garden with a stick. He didn't believe
in people coming in from New York first thing in the morning.
Didn't hold with it. Went against nature. He believed in virtually
everything else, though.

Probably them space aliens,' he said, bending over and prod-
ding at the edges of the small indentations with his stick. Hear
a lot about space aliens these days. I expect it's them.'

Do you?' said Tricia, looking furtively at her watch. Ten
minutes, she reckoned. Ten minutes she'd be able to stay
standing up. Then she would simply keel over, whether she
was in her bedroom or still out here in the garden. That was
if she just had to stand. If she also had to nod intelligently and
say Do you?' from time to time, it might cut it down to five.

Oh yes,' said Eric. They come down here, land on your lawn,
and then buzz off again, sometimes with your cat. Mrs Williams
at the Post Office, her cat - you know the ginger. one? - it got
abducted by space aliens. Course, they brought it back the next
day but it were in a very odd mood. Kept prowling around all
morning, and then falling asleep in the afternoon. Used to be
the other way round, is the point. Sleep in the morning, prowl in
the afternoon. Jet lag, you see, from being in an interplanetary
craft.'

I see,' said Tricia.

They dyed it tabby, too, she says. These marks are exactly
the sort of marks that their landing pods would probably make.'

You don't think it's the lawn mower?' asked Tricia.

If the marks were more round, I'd say, but these are just
off-round, you see. Altogether more alien in shape.'

It's just that you mentioned the lawn mower was playing
up and needed fixing or it might start gouging holes in the
lawn.'

I did say that, Miss Tricia, and I stand by what I said.
I'm not saying it's not the lawn mower for definite, I'm just
saying what seems to me more likely given the shapes of the
holes. They come in over these trees, you see, in their landing
pods...'

Eric...,' said Tricia, patiently.
Tell you what, though, Miss Tricia,' said Eric, I will take a
look at the mower, like I meant to last week, and leave you to
get on with whatever you' re wanting to.'

Thank you, Eric,' said Tricia. I'm going to bed now, in
fact. Help yourself to anything you want in the kitchen.'

Thank you, Miss Tricia, and good luck to you,' said Eric.
He bent over and picked something from the lawn.

There,' he said. Three-leaf clover. Good luck you see.'

He peered at it closely to check that it was a real three-leaf
clover and not just a regular four-leaf one that one of the leaves
had fallen off. If I were you, though, I'd watch for signs of alien
activity in the area.' He scanned the horizon keenly. Particularly
from over there in the Henley direction.'

Thank you, Eric,' said Tricia again. I will.'

She went to bed and dreamt fitfully of parrots and other birds.
In the afternoon she got up and prowled around restlessly, not
certain what to do with the rest of the day, or indeed the rest of
her life. She spent at least an hour dithering, trying to make up
her mind whether to head up into town and go to Stavro's for the
evening. This was the currently fashionable spot for high-flying
media people, and seeing a few friends there might help her ease
herself back into the swing of things. She decided at last she would
go. It was good. It was fun there. She was very fond of Stavro
himself, who was a Greek with a German father - a fairly odd
combination. Tricia had been to the Alpha a couple of nights
earlier, which was Stavro's original club in New York, now run
by his brother Karl, who thought of himself as a German with a
Greek mother. Stavro would be very happy to be told that Karl
was making a bit of a pig's ear of running the New York club,
so Tricia would go and make him happy. There was little love
lost between Stavro and Karl Mueller.

OK. That's what she would do.

She then spent another hour dithering about what to wear.
At last she settled on a smart little black dress she'd got in New
York. She phoned a friend to see who was likely to be at the
club that evening, and was told that it was closed this evening
for a private wedding party.

She thought that trying to live life according to any plan you
actually work out is like trying to buy ingredients for a recipe from
the supermarket. You get one of those trolleys which simply will
not go in the direction you push it and end up just having to buy
completely different stuff. What do you do with it? What do you
do with the recipe? She didn't know.

Anyway, that night an alien spacecraft landed on her lawn.

She watched it coming in from over the Henley direction with
mild curiosity at first, wondering what those lights were. Living,
as she did, not a million miles from Heathrow, she was used to
seeing lights in the sky. Not usually so late in the evening, or so
low, though, which was why she was mildly curious.

When whatever it was began to come closer and closer her
curiosity began to turn to bemusement.

Hmmm,' she thought, which was about as far as she could get
with thinking. She was still feeling dopey and jet-lagged and the
messages that one part of her brain was busy sending to another
were not necessarily arriving on time or the right way up. She left
the kitchen where she'd been fixing herself a coffee and went to
open the back door which led out to the garden. She took a deep
breath of cool evening air, stepped outside and looked up.

There was something roughly the size of a large camper
van parked about a hundred feet above her lawn.

It was really there. Hanging there. Almost silent.

Something moved deep inside her.

Her arms dropped slowly down to her side. She didn't notice
the scalding coffee slopping over her foot. She was hardly
breathing as slowly, inch by inch, foot by foot, the craft came
downwards. Its lights were playing softly over the ground as if
probing and feeling it. They played over her.

It seemed beyond all hope that she should be given her
chance again. Had he found her? Had he come back?
The craft dropped down and down until at last it had settled
quietly on her lawn. It didn't look exactly like the one she had
seen departing all those years ago, she thought, but flashing lights
in the night sky are hard to resolve into clear shapes.

Silence.

Then a click and a hum.

Then another click and another hum. Click hum, click hum.

A doorway slid open, spilling light towards her across the
lawn.

She waited, tingling.

A figure stood silhouetted in the light, then another, and
another.

Wide eyes blinked slowly at her. Hands were slowly raised
in greeting.

McMillan?' a voice said at last, a strange, thin voice that
managed the syllables with difficulty. Tricia McMillan. Ms Tricia
McMillan?'

Yes,' said Tricia, almost soundlessly.

We have been monitoring you.'

M... monitoring? Me?'

Yes.'

They looked at her for a while, their large eyes moving
up and down her very slowly.

You look smaller in real life,' one said at last.

What?' said Tricia.

Yes.'

I... I don't understand,' said Tricia. She hadn't expected any
of this, of course, but even for something she hadn't expected to
begin with it wasn't going the way she expected. At last she said,

Are you... are you from... Zaphod?'

This question seemed to cause a little consternation among the
three figures. They conferred with each other in some skittering
language of their own and then turned back to her.

We don't think so. Not as far as we know,' said one.

Where is Zaphod?' said another, looking up into the night sky.

I... I don't know, said Tricia, helplessly.

Is it far from here? Which direction? We don't know.'

Tricia realised with a sinking heart that they had no idea
who she was talking about. Or even what she was talking about.
And she had no idea what they were talking about. She put her
hopes tightly away again and snapped her brain back into gear.
There was no point in being disappointed. She had to wake up
to the fact that she had here the journalistic scoop of the cen-
tury. What should she do? Go back into the house for a video
camera? Wouldn't they just be gone when she got back? She
was thoroughly confused as to strategy. Keep'em talking, she
thought. Figure it out later.

You've been monitoring... me?'

All of you. Everything on your planet. TV. Radio. Tele-
communications. Computers. Video circuitry. Warehouses.'

What?'

Car parks. Everything. We monitor everything.'

Tricia stared at them.

That must be very boring, isn't it?' she blurted out.

Yes.'

So why...'

Except...'

Yes? Except what?'

Game shows. We quite like game shows.'

There was a terribly long silence as Tricia looked at the
aliens and the aliens looked at her.

There's something I would just like to get from indoors,'
said Tricia very deliberately. Tell you what. Would you, or
one of you, like to come inside with me and have a look?'

Very much,' they all said, enthusiastically.
 All three of them stood, slightly awkwardly in her sitting room,
as she hurried around picking up a video camera, a mm camera,
a tape recorder, every recording medium she could grab hold of.
They were all thin and, under domestic lighting conditions, a sort
of dim purplish green.

I really won't be a second, guys,' Tricia said, as she rummaged
through some drawers for spare tapes and films.

The aliens were looking at the shelves that held her CDs
and her old records. One of them nudged one of the others
very slightly.

Look,' he said. Elvis.'

Tricia stopped, and stared at them all over again.

You like Elvis?' she said.

Yes,' they said.

Elvis Presley?'

Yes.'

She shook her head in bewilderment as she tried to stuff
a new tape into her video camera.

Some of your people,' said one of her visitors, hesitantly,
think that Elvis has been kidnapped by space aliens.'

What?' said Tricia. Has he?'

It is possible.'

Are you telling me that you have kidnapped Elvis?' gasped
Tricia. She was trying to keep cool enough not to foul up her
equipment, but this was all almost too much for her.

No. Not us,' said her guests. Aliens. It is a very interesting
possibility. We talk of it often.'

I must get this down,' Tricia muttered to herself. She checked
her video was properly loaded and working now. She pointed the
camera at them. She didn't put it up to her eye because she didn't
want to freak them out. But she was sufficiently experienced to
be able to shoot accurately from the hip.

OK,' she said. Now tell me slowly and carefully who you
are. You first,' she said to the one on the left. What's your
name?'

I don't know.'

You don't know.'

No.'

I see,' said Tricia. And what about you other two?'

We don't know.'

Good. OK. Perhaps you can tell me where you are from?'

They shook their heads.

You don't know where you're from?'

They shook their heads again.

So,' said Tricia. What are you... er...'

She was floundering but, being a professional, kept the camera
steady while she did it.

We are on a mission,' said one of the aliens.

A mission? A mission to do what?'

We do not know.'

Still she kept the camera steady.

So what are you doing here on Earth, then?'

We have come to fetch you.'

Rock steady, rock steady. Could have been on a tripod. She
wondered if she should be using a tripod, in fact. She wondered
that because it gave her a moment or two to digest what they had
just said. No, she thought, hand-held gave her more flexibility.
She also thought, help, what am I going to do?

Why,' she asked, calmly, have you come to fetch me?'

Because we have lost our minds.'

Excuse me,' said Tricia, I'm going to have to get a tripod.'

They seemed happy enough to stand there doing nothing
while Tricia quickly found a tripod and mounted the camera on
it. Her face was completely immobile, but she did not have the
faintest idea what was going on or what to think about it.

OK,' she said, when she was ready. Why...'

We liked your interview with the astrologer.'

You saw it?'

We see everything. We are very interested in astrology.
We like it. It is very interesting. Not everything is interesting.
Astrology is interesting. What the stars tell us. What the stars
foretell. We could do with some information like that.'

But...'

Tricia didn't know where to start.

Own up, she thought. There's no point in trying to second
guess any of this stuff.

So she said, But I don't know anything about astrology.'

We do.'

You do?'

Yes. We follow our horoscopes. We are very avid. We see
all your newspapers and your magazines and are very avid with
them. But our leader says we have a problem.'

You have a leader?'

Yes.'

What's his name?'

We do not know.'

What does he say his name is, for Christ's sake? Sorry
I'll need to edit that. What does he say his name is?'

He does not know.'

So how do you all know he's the leader?'

He seized control. He said someone has to do something
round here.'

Ah! , said Tricia, seizing on a clue. Where is here''?'

Rupert.'

What?'

Your people call it Rupert. The tenth planet from your
sun. We have settled there for many years. It is highly cold
and uninteresting there. But good for monitoring.'

Why are you monitoring us?'

It is all we know to do.'

OK,' said Tricia. Right. What is the problem that your
leader says you have?'

Triangulation.'

I beg your pardon?'

Astrology is a very precise science. We know this.'

Well...' said Tricia, then left it at that.

But it is precise for you here on Earth.'

Ye... e... s...' She had a horrible feeling she was
getting a vague glimmering of something.

So when Venus is rising in Capricorn, for instance, that
is from Earth. How does that work if we are out on Rupert?
What if the Earth is rising in Capricorn? It is hard for us to
know. Amongst the things we have forgotten, which we think
are many and profound, is trigonometry.'

Let me get this straight,' said Tricia. You want me to
come with you to... Rupert...'

Yes.'

To recalculate your horoscopes for you to take account of
the relative positions of Earth and Rupert?'

Yes.'

Do I get an exclusive?'

Yes.'

I'm your girl,' said Tricia, thinking that at the very least
she could sell it to the National Enquirer.
 As she boarded the craft that would take her off to the furthest
limits of the Solar System, the first thing that met her eyes was
a bank of video monitors across which thousands of images were
sweeping. A fourth alien was sitting watching them, but was
focused on one particular screen that held a steady image. It
was a replay of the impromptu interview which Tricia had just
conducted with his three colleagues. He looked up when he saw
her apprehensively climbing in.

Good evening, Ms McMillan,' he said. Nice camera work.'

Ford Prefect hit the ground running. The ground was about three
inches further from the ventilation shaft than he remembered it
so he misjudged the point at which he would hit the ground,
started running too soon, stumbled awkwardly and twisted his
ankle. Damn! He ran off down the corridor anyway, hobbling
slightly.

All over the building, alarms were erupting into their usual
frenzy of excitement. He dived for cover behind the usual storage
cabinets, glanced around to check that he was unseen, and started
rapidly to fish around inside his satchel for the usual things he
needed.

His ankle, unusually, was hurting like hell.

The ground was not only three inches further from the ven-
tilation shaft than he remembered, it was also on a different
planet than he remembered, but it was the three inches that
had caught him by surprise. The offices of the Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy were quite often shifted at very short
notice to another planet, for reasons of local climate, local
hostility, power bills or tax, but they were always reconstructed
exactly the same way, almost to the very molecule. For many of
the company's employees, the layout of their offices represented
the only constant they knew in a severely distorted personal uni-
verse.

Something, though, was odd.

This was not in itself surprising, thought Ford as he pulled
out his lightweight throwing towel. Virtually everything in his
life was, to a greater or lesser extent, odd. It was just that this
was odd in a slightly different way than he was used to things
being odd, which was, well, strange. He couldn't quite get it into
focus immediately.

He got out his No. gauge prising tool.
The alarms were going in the same old way that he knew
well. There was a kind of music to them that he could almost
hum along to. That was all very familiar. The world outside had
been a new one on Ford. He had not been to Saquo-Pilia Hensha
before, and he had liked it. It had a kind of carnival atmosphere
to it.

He took from his satchel a toy bow and arrow which he
had bought in a street market.

He had discovered that the reason for the carnival atmosphere
on Saquo-Pilia Hensha was that the local people were celebrating
the annual feast of the Assumption of St Antwelm. St Antwelm
had been, during his lifetime, a great and popular king who had
made a great and popular assumption. What King Antwelm had
assumed was that what everybody wanted, all other things being
equal, was to be happy and enjoy themselves and have the best
possible time together. On his death he had willed his entire per-
sonal fortune to financing an annual festival to remind everyone
of this, with lots of good food and dancing and very silly games
like Hunt the Wocket. His Assumption had been such a brilliantly
good one that he was made into a saint for it. Not only that, but all
the people who had previously been made saints for doing things
like being stoned to death in a thoroughly miserable way or living
upside down in barrels of dung were instantly demoted and were
now thought to be rather embarrassing.

The familiar H-shaped building of the Hitch Hiker's Guide
offices rose above the outskirts of the city, and Ford Prefect
had broken into it in the familiar way. He always entered via the
ventilation system rather than the main lobby because the main
lobby was patrolled by robots whose job it was to quiz incoming
employees about their expense accounts. Ford Prefect's expense
accounts were notoriously complex and difficult affairs and he had
found, on the whole, that the lobby robots were ill-equipped to
understand the arguments he wished to put forward in relation to
them. He preferred, therefore, to make his entrance by another
route.

This meant setting off nearly every alarm in the building, but
not the one in the accounts department, which was the way that
Ford preferred it.

He hunkered down behind the storage cabinet, he licked
the rubber suction cup of the toy arrow, and then fitted it
to the string of the bow.

Within about thirty seconds a security robot the size of a
small melon came flying down the corridor at about waist height,
scanning left and right for anything unusual as it did so.

With impeccable timing Ford shot the toy arrow across its
path. The arrow flew across the corridor and stuck, wobbling,
on the opposite wall. As it flew, the robot's sensors locked on
to it instantly and the robot twisted through ninety degrees to
follow it, see what the hell it was and where it was going.

This bought Ford one precious second, during which the
robot was looking in the opposite direction from him. He
hurled the towel over the flying robot and caught it.

Because of the various sensory protuberances with which the
robot was festooned, it couldn't manoeuvre inside the towel, and
it just twitched back and forth without being able to turn and face
its captor.

Ford hauled it quickly towards him and pinned it down to
the ground. It was beginning to whine pitifully. With one swift
and practised movement, Ford reached under the towel with his
No. gauge prising tool and flipped off the small plastic panel on
top of the robot which gave access to its logic circuits.

Now logic is a wonderful thing but it has, as the processes
of evolution discovered, certain drawbacks.

Anything that thinks logically can be fooled by something
else which thinks at least as logically as it does. The easiest
way to fool a completely logical robot is to feed it the same
stimulus sequence over and over again so it gets locked in a
loop. This was best demonstrated by the famous Herring Sand-
wich experiments conducted millennia ago at MISPWOSO (The
MaxiMegalon Institute of Slowly and Painfully Working Out the
Surprisingly Obvious).

A robot was programmed to believe that it liked herring
sandwiches. This was actually the most difficult part of the
whole experiment. Once the robot had been programmed to
believe that it liked herring sandwiches, a herring sandwich was
placed in front of it. Whereupon the robot thought to itself, Ah!
A herring sandwich! I like herring sandwiches.'

It would then bend over and scoop up the herring sandwich
in its herring sandwich scoop, and then straighten up again.
Unfortunately for the robot, it was fashioned in such a way that
the action of straightening up caused the herring sandwich to slip
straight back off its herring sandwich scoop and fall on to the floor
in front of the robot. Whereupon the robot thought to itself, Ah!
A herring sandwich..., etc., and repeated the same action over
and over and over again. The only thing that prevented the her-
ring sandwich from getting bored with the whole damn business
and crawling off in search of other ways of passing the time was
that the herring sandwich, being just a bit of dead fish between
a couple of slices of bread, was marginally less alert to what was
going on than was the robot.

The scientists at the Institute thus discovered the driving
force behind all change, development and innovation in life,
which was this: herring sandwiches. They published a paper
to this effect, which was widely criticised as being extremely
stupid. They checked their figures and realised that what they
had actually discovered was boredom', or rather, the practical
function of boredom. In a fever of excitement they then went
on to discover other emotions, Like irritability', depression',
reluctance', ickiness' and so on. The next big breakthrough came
when they stopped using herring sandwiches, whereupon a whole
welter of new emotions became suddenly available to them for
study, such as relief', joy', friskiness', appetite', satisfaction',
and most important of all, the desire for happiness'.

This was the biggest breakthrough of all.

Vast wodges of complex computer code governing robot behav-
iour in all possible contingencies could be replaced very simply.
All that robots needed was the capacity to be either bored or
happy, and a few conditions that needed to be satisfied in order
to bring those states about. They would then work the rest out
for themselves.

The robot which Ford had got trapped under his towel was
not, at the moment a happy robot. It was happy when it could
move about. It was happy when it could see other things. It was
particularly happy when it could see other things moving about,
particularly if the other things were moving about doing things
they shouldn't do because it could then, with considerable delight,
report them.

Ford would soon fix that.

He squatted over the robot and held it between his knees. The
towel was still covering all of its sensory mechanisms, but Ford
had now got its logic circuits exposed. The robot was whirring
grungily and pettishly, but it could only fidget, it couldn't actually
move. Using the prising tool, Ford eased a small chip out from its
socket. As soon as it came out, the robot went quiet and just sat
there in a coma.

The chip Ford had taken out was the one which contained
the instructions for all the conditions that had to be fulfilled in
order for the robot to feel happy. The robot would be happy
when a tiny electrical charge from a point just to the left of the
chip reached another point just to the right of the chip. The chip
determined whether the charge got there or not.

Ford pulled out a small length of wire that had been threaded
into the towel. He dug one end of it into the top left hole of the
chip socket and the other into the bottom right hole.

That was all it took. Now the robot would be happy whatever
happened.

Ford quickly stood up and whisked the towel away. The
robot rose ecstatically into the air, pursuing a kind of wriggly
path.

It turned and saw Ford.

Mr Prefect, sir! I'm so happy to see you!'

Good to see you, little fella,' said Ford.

The robot rapidly reported back to its central control that
everything was now for the best in this best of all possible
worlds, the alarms rapidly quelled themselves, and life returned
to normal.

At least, almost to normal.

There was something odd about the place.

The little robot was gurgling with electric delight. Ford hurried
on down the corridor, letting the thing bob along in his wake
telling him how delicious everything was, and how happy it was
to be able to tell him that.

Ford, however , was not happy.

He passed faces of people he didn't know. They didn't look
like his sort of people. They were too well groomed. Their
eyes were too dead. Every time he thought he saw someone
he recognised in the distance, and hurried along to say hello,
it would turn out to be someone else, with an altogether neater
hairstyle and a much more thrusting, purposeful look than, well,
than anybody Ford knew.

A staircase had been moved a few inches to the left. A
ceiling had been lowered slightly. A Lobby had been remodelled.
All these things were not worrying in themselves, though they
were a little disorienting. The thing that was worrying was the
decor. It used to be brash and glitzy. Expensive - because the
Guide sold so well through the civilised and post-civilised Galaxy
- but expensive and fun. Wild games machines lined the corridors.
Insanely painted grand pianos hung from ceilings, vicious sea
creatures from the planet Viv reared up out of pools in tree-filled
atria, robot butlers in stupid shirts roamed the corridors seeking
whose hands they might press frothing drinks into. People used
to have pet vastdragons on leads and pterospondes on perches in
their offices. People knew how to have a good time, and if they
didn't there were courses they could sign up for which would put
that right.

There was none of that now.

Somebody had been through the place doing some iniquitous
kind of taste job on it.

Ford turned sharply into a small alcove, cupped his hand
and yanked the flying robot in with him. He squatted down
and peered at the burbling cybernaut.

What's been happening here?' he demanded.

Oh just the nicest things, sir, just the nicest possible things.
Can I sit on your lap, please?'

No,' said Ford, brushing the thing away. It was overjoyed
to be spurned in this way and started to bob and burble and
swoon. Ford grabbed it again and stuck it firmly in the air a
foot in front of his face. It tried to stay where it was put but
couldn't help quivering slightly.

Something's changed, hasn't it?' Ford hissed.

Oh yes,' squealed the little robot, in the most fabulous
and wonderful way. I feel so good about it.'

Well what was it like before, then?'

Scrumptious.'

But you like the way it's changed?' demanded Ford.

I like everything,' moaned the robot. Especially when you
shout at me like that. Do it again, please.'

Just tell me what's happened!'

Oh thank you, thank you!'

Ford sighed.

OK, OK,' panted the robot. The Guide has been taken over.
There's a new management. It's all so gorgeous I could just melt.
The old management was also fabulous of course, though I'm not
sure if I thought so at the time.'

That was before you had a bit of wire stuck in your head.'

How true. How wonderfully true. How wonderfully, bub-
blingly, frothingly, burstingly true. What a truly ecstasy-induc-
ingly correct observation.'

What's happened?' insisted Ford. Who is this new man-
agement? When did they take over? I... oh, never mind,' he
added, as the little robot started to gibbet with uncontrollable
joy and rub itself against his knee. I'll go and find out for myself.'
 Ford hurled himself at the door of the editor-in-chief's office,
tucked himself into a tight ball as the frame splintered and
gave way, rolled rapidly across the floor to where the drinks
trolley laden with some of the Galaxy's most potent and expen-
sive beverages habitually stood, seized hold of the trolley and,
using it to give himself cover, trundled it and himself across the
main exposed part of the office floor to where the valuable and
extremely rude statue of Leda and the Octopus stood, and took
shelter behind it. Meanwhile the little security robot, entering at
chest height, was suicidally delighted to draw gunfire away from
Ford.

That, at least, was the plan, and a necessary one. The current
editor-in-chief, Stagyar-zil-Doggo, was a dangerously unbalanced
man who took a homicidal view of contributing staff turning up in
his office without pages of fresh, proofed copy, and had a battery
of laser guided guns linked to special scanning devices in the door
frame to deter anybody who was merely bringing extremely good
reasons why they hadn't written any. Thus was a high level of
output maintained.

Unfortunately the drinks trolley wasn't there.

Ford hurled himself desperately sideways and somersaulted
towards the statue of Leda and the Octopus, which also wasn't
there. He rolled and hurtled around the room in a kind of random
panic, tripped, span, hit the window, which fortunately was built
to withstand rocket attacks, rebounded, and fell in a bruised and
winded heap behind a smart grey crushed leather sofa, which
hadn't been there before.

After a few seconds he slowly peeked up above the top of the
sofa. As well as there being no drinks trolley and no Leda and
the Octopus, there had also been a startling absence of gunfire.
He frowned. This was all utterly wrong.

Mr Prefect, I assume,' said a voice.

The voice came from a smooth-faced individual behind a
large ceramo-teak-bonded desk. Stagyar-zil-Doggo may well have
been a hell of an individual, but no one, for a whole variety of
reasons, would ever have called him smooth-faced. This was not
Stagyar-zil-Doggo.

I assume from the manner of your entrance that you do not
have new material for the, er, Guide, at the moment,' said the
smooth-faced individual. He was sitting with his elbows resting
on the table and holding his fingertips together in a manner
which, inexplicably, has never been made a capital offence.

I've been busy,' said Ford, rather weakly. He staggered
to his feet, brushing himself down. Then he thought, what the
hell was he saying things weakly for? He had to get on top of
this situation. He had to find out who the hell this person was,
and he suddenly thought of a way of doing it.

Who the hell are you?, he demanded.

I am your new editor-in-chief. That is, if we decide to
retain your services. My name is Vann Harl.' He didn't put his
hand out. He just added, What have you done to that security
robot?'

The little robot was rolling very, very slowly round the ceiling
and moaning quietly to itself.

I've made it very happy,' snapped Ford. It's a kind of
mission I have. Where's Stagyar? More to the point, where's
his drinks trolley?'

Mr zil-Doggo is no longer with this organisation. His drinks
trolley is, I imagine, helping to console him for this fact.'

Organisation?' yelled Ford. Organisation? What a bloody
stupid word for a set-up like this!'

Precisely our sentiments. Under-structured, over-resourced,
under-managed, over-inebriated. And that,' said Harl, was just
the editor.'

I'll do the jokes,' snarled Ford.

No,' said Harl. You will do the restaurant column.'

He tossed a piece of plastic on to the desk in front of
him. Ford did not move to pick it up.

You what?' said Ford.

No. Me Harl. You Prefect. You do restaurant column. Me
editor. Me sit here tell you you do restaurant column. You get?'

Restaurant column?' said Ford, too bewildered to be really
angry yet.

Siddown, Prefect,' said Harl. He swung round in his swivel
chair, got to his feet, and stood staring out at the tiny specks
enjoying the carnival twenty-three stories below.

Time to get this business on its feet, Prefect,' he snapped.

We at InfiniDim Enterprises are...'

You at what?'

InfiniDim Enterprises. We have bought out the Guide.'

InfiniDim?'

We spent millions on that name, Prefect. Start liking it
or start packing.'

Ford shrugged. He had nothing to pack.

The Galaxy is changing,' said Harl. We've got to change
with it. Go with the market. The market is moving up. New
aspirations. New technology. The future is...'

Don't tell me about the future,' said Ford. I've been all over
the future. Spend half my time there. It' s the same as anywhere
else. Anywhen else. Whatever. Just the same old stuff in faster
cars and smellier air.'

That's one future,' said Harl. That's your future, if you
accept it. you've got to learn to think multi-dimensionally.
There are limitless futures stretching out in every direction from
this moment - and from this moment and from this. Billions of
them, bifurcating every instant! Every possible position of every
possible electron balloons out into billions of probabilities! Bil-
lions and billions of shining, gleaming futures! you know what
that means?'

You're dribbling down your chin.'

Billions and billions of markets!'

I see,' said Ford. So you sell billions and billions of Guides.'

No,' said Harl, reaching for his handkerchief and not finding
one. Excuse me,' he said, but this gets me so excited.' Ford
handed him his towel.

The reason we don't sell billions and billions of Guides,'
continued Harl, after wiping his mouth, is the expense. What we
do is we sell one Guide billions and billions of times. We exploit
the multidimensional nature of the Universe to cut down on
manufacturing costs. And we don't sell to penniless hitch hikers.
What a stupid notion that was! Find the one section of the market
that, more or less by definition, doesn't have any money, and try
and sell to it. No. We sell to the affluent business traveller and
his vacationing wife in a billion, billion different futures . This is
the most radical, dynamic and thrusting business venture in the
entire multidimensional infinity of space time probability ever.'

And you want me to be its restaurant critic,' said Ford.

We would value your input.'

Kill!' shouted Ford. He shouted it at his towel.

The towel leapt up out of Harl's hands.

This was not because it had any motive force of its own,
but because Harl was so startled at the idea that it might.
The next thing that startled him was the sight of Ford Prefect
hurtling across the desk at him fists first. In fact Ford was just
lunging for the credit card, but you don't get to occupy the sort
of position that Harl occupied in the sort of organisation in
which Harl occupied it without developing a healthily paranoid
view of life. He took the sensible precaution of hurling himself
backwards, and striking his head a sharp blow on the rocket-proof
glass, then subsided into a series of worrying and highly personal
dreams.

Ford lay on the desk, surprised at how swimmingly every-
thing had gone. He glanced quickly at the piece of plastic he
now held in his hand - it was a Dine-O-Charge credit card with
his name already embossed on it, and an expiry date two years
from now, and was possibly the single most exciting thing Ford
had ever seen in his life - then he clambered over the desk to
see to Harl.

He was breathing fairly easily. It occurred to Ford that he
might breathe more easily yet without the weight of his wallet
bearing down on his chest, so he slipped it out of Harl's breast
pocket and flipped through it. Fair amount of cash. Credit tokens.
Ultragolf club membership. Other club memberships. Photos of
someone's wife and family - presumably Harl's, but it was hard
to be sure these days. Busy executives often didn't have time
for a full-time wife and family and would just rent them for
weekends.

Ha!

He couldn't believe what he'd just found.

He slowly drew out from the wallet a single and insanely
exciting piece of plastic that was nestling amongst a bunch of
receipts.

It wasn't insanely exciting to look at. It was rather dull in
fact. It was smaller and a little thicker than a credit card and
semi-transparent. If you held it up to the light you could see
a lot of holographically encoded information and images buried
pseudo-inches deep beneath its surface .

It was an Ident-i-Eeze, and was a very naughty and silly
thing for Harl to have lying around in his wallet, though it was
perfectly understandable. There were so many different ways in
which you were required to provide absolute proof of your iden-
tity these days that life could easily become extremely tiresome
just from that factor alone, never mind the deeper existential
problems of trying to function as a coherent consciousness in an
epistemologically ambiguous physical universe. Just look at cash
point machines, for instance. Queues of people standing around
waiting to have their fingerprints read, their retinas scanned, bits
of skin scraped from the nape of the neck and undergoing instant
(or nearly instant - a good six or seven seconds in tedious
reality) genetic analysis, then having to answer trick questions
about members of their family they didn't even remember they
had, and about their recorded preferences for tablecloth colours.
And that was just to get a bit of spare cash for the weekend. If
you were trying to raise a loan for a jetcar, sign a missile treaty
or pay an entire restaurant bill things could get really trying.

Hence the Ident-i-Eeze. This encoded every single piece of
information about you, your body and your life into one all-
purpose machine-readable card that you could then carry around
in your wallet, and therefore represented technology's greatest
triumph to date over both itself and plain common sense.

Ford pocketed it. A remarkably good idea had just occurred
to him. He wondered how long Harl would remain unconscious.

Hey!' he shouted to the little melon-sized robot still slobbering
with euphoria up on the ceiling. You want to stay happy?'

The robot gurgled that it did.

Then stick with me and do everything I tell you without fail.'

The robot said that it was quite happy where it was up
on the ceiling thank you very much. It had never realised
before how much sheer titillation there was to be got from a
good ceiling and it wanted to explore its feelings about ceilings
in greater depth.

You stay there,' said Ford, and you'll soon be recaptured
and have your conditional chip replaced. You want to stay
happy, come now.'

The robot let out a long heartfelt sigh of impassioned tristesse
and sank reluctantly away from the ceiling.

Listen,' said Ford, can you keep the rest of the security
system happy for a few minutes?'

One of the joys of true happiness,' trilled the robot, is
sharing. I brim, I froth, I overflow with...'

OK,' said Ford. Just spread a little happiness around the
security network. Don't give it any information. Just make it
feel good so it doesn't feel the need to ask for any.'

He picked up his towel and ran cheerfully for the door.
Life had been a little dull of late. It showed every sign now
of becoming extremely froody.

Arthur Dent had been in some hell-holes in his life, but he had
never before seen a spaceport which had a sign saying, Even
travelling despondently is better than arriving here.' To welcome
visitors the arrivals hall featured a picture of the President of
NowWhat, smiling. It was the only picture anybody could find
of him, and it had been taken shortly after he had shot himself
so although the photo had been retouched as well as could be
managed the smile it wore was rather a ghastly one. The side
of his head had been drawn back in in crayon. No replacement
had been found for the photograph because no replacement had
been found for the President. There was only one ambition which
anyone on the planet ever had, and that was to leave.

Arthur checked himself into a small motel on the outskirts of
town, and sat glumly on the bed, which was damp, and flipped
through the little information brochure, which was also damp. It
said that the planet of NowWhat had been named after the open-
ing words of the first settlers to arrive there after struggling across
light years of space to reach the furthest unexplored outreaches of
the Galaxy. The main town was called OhWell. There weren't any
other towns to speak of. Settlement on NowWhat had not been
a success and the sort of people who actually wanted to live on
NowWhat were not the sort of people you would want to spend
time with.

Trading was mentioned in the brochure. The main trade that
was carried out was in the skins of the NowWhattian boghog but
it wasn't a very successful one because no one in their right minds
would want to buy a NowWhattian boghog skin. The trade only
hung on by its fingernails because there was always a significant
number of people in the Galaxy who were not in their right minds.
Arthur had felt very uncomfortable looking around at some of
the other occupants of the small passenger compartment of the
ship.

The brochure described some of the history of the planet.
Whoever had written it had obviously started out trying to drum
up a little enthusiasm for the place by stressing that it wasn't
actually cold and wet all the time, but could find little positive
to add to this so the tone of the piece quickly degenerated into
savage irony.

It talked about the early years of settlement. It said that the
major activities pursued on NowWhat were those of catching,
skinning and eating NowWhattian boghogs, which were the only
extant form of animal life on NowWhat, all other having long
ago died of despair. The boghogs were tiny, vicious creatures,
and the small margin by which they fell short of being completely
inedible was the margin by which life on the planet subsisted.
So what were the rewards, however small, that made life on
NowWhat worth living? Well, there weren't any. Not a one.
Even making yourself some protective clothing out of boghog
skins was an exercise in disappointment and futility, since the
skins were unaccountably thin and leaky. This caused a lot of
puzzled conjecture amongst the settlers. What was the boghog's
secret of keeping warm? If anyone had ever learnt the language
the boghogs spoke to each other they would have discovered
that there was no trick. The boghogs were as cold and wet as
anyone else on the planet. No one had had the slightest desire
to learn the language of the boghogs for the simple reason that
these creatures communicated by biting each other very hard on
the thigh. Life on NowWhat being what it was, most of what a
boghog might have to say about it could easily be signified by
these means.

Arthur flipped through the brochure till he found what he
was looking for. At the back there were a few maps of the
planet. They were fairly rough and ready because they weren't
likely to be of much interest to anyone, but they told him what
he wanted to know.

He didn't recognise it at first because the maps were the
other way up from the way he would have expected and looked,
therefore thoroughly unfamiliar. Of course, up and down, north
and south, are absolutely arbitrary designations, but we are used
to seeing things the way we are used to seeing them, and
Arthur had to turn the maps upside-down to make sense of
them.

There was one huge landmass off on the upper left-hand
side of the page which tapered down to a tiny waist and then
ballooned out again like a large comma. On the right-hand side
was a collection of large shapes jumbled familiarly together. The
outlines were not exactly the same, and Arthur didn't know if this
was because the map was so rough, or because the sea-level was
higher or because, well, things were just different here. But the
evidence was inarguable.

This was definitely the Earth.

Or rather, it most definitely was not.

It merely looked a lot like the Earth and occupied the same
co-ordinates in space time. What co-ordinates it occupied in
Probability was anybody's guess.

He sighed.

This, he realised, was about as close to home as he was
likely to get. Which meant that he was about as far from home
as he could possibly be. Glumly he slapped the brochure shut
and wondered what on earth he was going to do next.

He allowed himself a hollow laugh at what he had just
thought. He looked at his old watch, and shook it a bit to wind it.
It had taken him, according to his own time-scale, a year of hard
travelling to get here. A year since the accident in hyperspace in
which Fenchurch had completely vanished. One minute she had
been sitting there next to him in the SlumpJet; the next minute
the ship had done a perfectly normal hyperspace hop and when
he had next looked she was not there. The seat wasn't even
warm. Her name wasn't even on the passenger list.

The spaceline had been wary of him when he had complained.
A lot of awkward things happen in space travel, and a lot of them
make a lot of money for lawyers. But when they had asked him
what Galactic Sector he and Fenchurch had been from and he
had said ZZ Plural Z Alpha they had relaxed completely in a
way that Arthur wasn't at all sure he liked. They even laughed
a little, though sympathetically, of course. They pointed to the
clause in the ticket contract which said that the entities whose
lifespans had originated in any of the Plural zones were advised
not to travel in hyperspace and did so at their own risk. Every-
body, they said, knew that. They tittered slightly and shook their
heads.

As Arthur had left their offices he found he was trembling
slightly. Not only had he lost Fenchurch in the most complete
and utter way possible, but he felt that the more time he spent
away out in the Galaxy the more it seemed that the number of
things he didn't know anything about actually increased.

Just as he was lost for a moment in these numb memories a
knock came on the door of his motel room, which then opened
immediately. A fat and dishevelled man came in carrying Arthur's
one small case.

He got as far as, Where shall I put -' when there was
a sudden violent flurry and he collapsed heavily against the
door, trying to beat off a small and mangy creature that had
leapt snarling out of the wet night and buried its teeth in his
thigh, even through the thick layers of leather padding he wore
there. There was a brief, ugly confusion of jabbering and thrash-
ing. The man shouted frantically and pointed. Arthur grabbed a
hefty stick that stood next to the door expressly for this purpose
and beat at the boghog with it.

The boghog suddenly disengaged and limped backwards, dazed
and forlorn. It turned anxiously in the corner of the room, its tail
tucked up right under its back legs, and stood looking nervously
up at Arthur, jerking its head awkwardly and repeatedly to one
side. Its jaw seemed to be dislocated. It cried a little and scraped
its damp tail across the floor. By the door, the fat man with
Arthur's suitcase was sitting and cursing, trying to staunch the
flow of blood from his thigh. His clothes were already wet from
the rain.

Arthur stared at the boghog, not knowing what to do. The
boghog looked at him questioningly. It tried to approach him,
waking mournful little whimpering noises. It moved its jaw pain-
fully. It made a sudden leap for Arthur's thigh, but its dislocated
jaw was too weak to get a grip and it sank, whining sadly, down
to the floor. The fat man jumped to his feet, grabbed the stick,
beat the boghog's brains into a sticky, pulpy mess on the thin
carpet, and then stood there breathing heavily as if daring the
animal to move again, just once.

A single boghog eyeball sat looking reproachfully at Arthur
from out of the mashed ruins of its head.

What do you think it was trying to say?' asked Arthur
in a small voice.

Ah, nothing much,' said the man Just its way of trying
to be friendly. This is just our way of being friendly back,'
he added, gripping the stick.

When's the next flight out?' asked Arthur.

Thought you'd only just arrived,' said the man.

Yes,' said Arthur. It was only going to be a brief visit.
I just wanted to see if this was the right place or not. Sorry.'

You mean you're on the wrong planet?' said the man lugu-
briously. Funny how many people say that. Specially the people
who live here.' He eyed the remains of the boghog with a deep,
ancestral resentment.

Oh no,' said Arthur, 'it's the right planet all right.' He
picked up the damp brochure lying on the bed and put it in
his pocket. It's OK, thanks, I'll take that,' he said, taking his
case from the man. He went to the door and looked out into
the cold, wet night.

Yes, it's the right planet, all right,' he said again. Right
planet, wrong universe.'

A single bird wheeled in the sky above him as he set off
back for the spaceport.

Ford had his own code of ethics. It wasn't much of one, but it
was his and he stuck by it, more or less. One rule he made was
never to buy his own drinks. He wasn't sure if that counted as an
ethic, but you have to go with what you've got. He was also firmly
and utterly opposed to all and any forms of cruelty to any animals
whatsoever except geese. And furthermore he would never steal
from his employers.

Well, not exactly steal.

If his accounts supervisor didn't start to hyperventilate and
put out a seal-all-exits security alert when Ford handed in his
expenses claim then Ford felt he wasn't doing his job properly.
But actually stealing was another thing. That was biting the hand
that feeds you. Sucking very hard on it, even nibbling it in an
affectionate kind of a way was OK, but you didn't actually bite
it. Not when that hand was the Guide. The Guide was something
sacred and special.

But that, thought Ford as he ducked and weaved his way
down through the building, was about to change. And they
had only themselves to blame. Look at all this stuff. Lines of
neat grey office cubicles and executive workstation pods. The
whole place was dreary with the hum of memos and minutes of
meetings flitting through its electronic networks. Out in the street
they were playing Hunt the Wocket for Zark's sake, but here in
the very heart of the Guide offices no one was even recklessly
kicking a ball around the corridors or wearing inappropriately
coloured beachware.

InfiniDim Enterprises,' Ford snarled to himself as he stalked
rapidly down one corridor after another. Door after door magi-
cally opened to him without question. Elevators took him happily
to places they should not. Ford was trying to pursue the most
tangled and complicated route he could, heading generally down-
wards through the building. His happy little robot took care of
everything, spreading waves of acquiescent joy through all the
security circuits it encountered.

Ford thought it needed a name and decided to call it Emily
Saunders, after a girl he had very fond memories of. Then he
thought that Emily Saunders was an absurd name for a security
robot, and decided to call it Colin instead, after Emily's dog.

He was moving deep into the bowels of the building now,
into areas he had never entered before, areas of higher and
higher security. He was beginning to encounter puzzled looks
from the operatives he passed. At this level of security you
didn't even call them people anymore. And they were probably
doing stuff that only operatives would do. When they went home
to their families in the evening they became people again, and
when their little children looked up to them with their sweet
shining eyes and said Daddy, what did you do all day today?'
they just said, I performed my duties as an operative,' and left
it at that.

The truth of the matter was that all sorts of highly dodgy
stuff went on behind the cheery, happy-go-lucky front that the
Guide liked to put up - or used to like to put up before this new
InfiniDim Enterprises bunch marched in and started to make the
whole thing highly dodgy. There were all kinds of tax scams and
rackets and graft and shady deals supporting the shining edifice,
and down in the secure research and data-processing levels of
the building was where it all went on.

Every few years the Guide would set up its business, and
indeed its building on a new world, and all would be sunshine
and laughter for a while as the Guide would put down its roots
in the local culture and economy, provide employment, a sense
of glamour and adventure and, in the end, not quite as much
actual revenue as the locals had expected.

When the Guide moved on, taking its building with it, it
left a little like a thief in the night. Exactly like a thief in
the night in fact. It usually left in the very early hours of
the morning, and the following day there always turned out
to be a very great deal of stuff missing. Whole cultures and
economies would collapse in its wake, often within a week,
leaving once thriving planets desolate and shell-shocked but
still somehow feeling they had been part of some great adven-
ture.

The operatives' who shot puzzled glances at Ford as he
marched on into the depths of the building's most sensitive
areas were reassured by the presence of Colin, who was flying
along with him in a buzz of emotional fulfilment and easing his
path for him at every stage.

Alarms were starting to go off in other parts of the building.
Perhaps that meant that Vann Harl had already been discovered,
which might be a problem. Ford had been hoping he would be
able to slip the Ident-i-Eeze back into his pocket before he came
round. Well, that was a problem for later, and he didn't for the
moment have the faintest idea how he was going to solve it. For
the moment he wasn't going to worry. Wherever he went with
little Colin, he was surrounded by a cocoon of sweetness and
light and, most importantly, willing and acquiescent elevators
and positively obsequious doors.

Ford even began to whistle, which was probably his mistake.
Nobody likes a whistler, particularly not the divinity that shapes
our ends.

The next door wouldn't open.

And that was a pity, because it was the very one that Ford
had been making for. It stood there before him, grey and
resolutely closed with a sign on it saying:

 NO ADMITTANCE. NOT EVEN TO AUTHORISED PERSONNEL. YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME HERE. GO AWAY.
Colin reported that the doors had been getting generally a
lot grimmer down in these lower reaches of the building.

They were about ten stories below ground level now. The
air was refrigerated and the tasteful grey hessian wall-weave
had given way to brutal grey bolted steel walls. Colin's rampant
euphoria had subsided into a kind of determined cheeriness. He
said that he was beginning to tire a little. It was taking all his
energy to pump the slightest bonhomie whatsoever into the doors
down here.

Ford kicked at the door. It opened.

Mixture of pleasure and pain,' he muttered. Always does
the trick.'

 He walked in and Colin flew in after him. Even with a
wire stuck straight into his pleasure electrode his happiness
was a nervous kind of happiness. He bobbed around a little.

The room was small, grey and humming.

This was the nerve centre of the entire Guide.

The computer terminals that lined the grey walls were win-
dows on to every aspect of the Guide's operations. Here, on the
left-hand side of the room, reports were gathered over the Sub-
Etha-Net from field researchers in every corner of the Galaxy,
fed straight up into the network of sub-editor's offices where they
had all the good bits cut out by secretaries because the sub-editors
were out having lunch. The remaining copy would then be shot
across to the other half of the building - the other leg of the H'
- which was the legal department. The legal department would
cut out anything that was still even remotely good from what
remained and fire it back to the offices of the executive editors,
who were also out at lunch. So the editors' secretaries would read
it and say it was stupid and cut most of what was left.

When any of the editors finally staggered in from lunch they
would exclaim What is this feeble crap that X' - where X was
the name of the field researcher in question - has sent us from
half-way across the bloody Galaxy? What's the point of having
somebody spending three whole orbital periods out in the bloody
Gagrakacka Mind Zones, with all that stuff going on out there,
if this load of anaemic squitter is the best he can be bothered to
send us. Disallow his expenses!'

What shall we do with the copy?' the secretary would ask.

Ah, put it out over the network. Got to have something
going out there. I've got a headache, I'm going home.'

So the edited copy would go for one last slash and burn
through the legal department, and then be sent back down
here where it would be broadcast out over the Sub-Etha-Net
for instantaneous retrieval anywhere in the Galaxy. That was
handled by equipment which was monitored and controlled by
the terminals on the right-hand side of the room.

Meanwhile the order to disallow the researcher's expenses
was relayed down to the computer terminal stuck off in the
right-hand corner, and it was to this terminal that Ford Prefect
now swiftly made his way.

(If you are reading this on planet Earth then:
Good luck to you. There is an awful lot of stuff you
don't know anything about, but you are not alone in this. It's
just that in your case the consequences of not knowing any of
this stuff are particularly terrible, but then, hey, that's just the
way the cookie gets completely stomped on and obliterated.
 Don't imagine you know what a computer terminal is.
A computer terminal is not some clunky old television with
a typewriter in front of it. It is an interface where the mind and
body can connect with the universe and move bits of it about.)

Ford hurried over to the terminal, sat in front of it and
quickly dipped himself into its universe.

It wasn't the normal universe he knew. It was a universe of
densely enfolded worlds, of wild topographies, towering moun-
tain peaks, heart stopping ravines, of moons shattering off into
sea horses, hurtful blurting crevices, silently heaving oceans and
bottomless hurtling hooping funts.

He held still to get his bearings. He controlled his breathing,
closed his eyes and looked again.

So this was where accountants spent their time. There was
clearly more to them than met the eye. He looked around
carefully, trying not to let it all swell and swim and overwhelm
him.

He didn't know his way around this universe. He didn't
even know the physical laws that determined its dimensional
extents or behaviours, but his instinct told him to look for the
most outstanding feature he could detect and make towards it.

Way off in some indistinguishable distance - was it a mile
or a million or a mote in his eye? - was a stunning peak that
overarched the sky, climbed and climbed and spread out in
flowering aigrettes , agglomerates , and arch imandrites .

He weltered towards it, hooling and thurling, and at last
reached it in a meaninglessly long umthingth of time.

He clung to it, arms outspread, gripping tightly on to its
roughly gnarled and pitted surface. Once he was certain that
he was secure he made the hideous mistake of looking down.

While he had been weltering, hooling and thurling, the distance
beneath him had not bothered him unduly, but now that he was
an ornamental tuft of plumes, a jumbled mass and a cleric ranking below a bishop
gripping, the distance made his heart wilt and his brain bend.
His fingers were white with pain and tension. His teeth were
grinding and twisting against each other beyond his control. His
eyes turned inwards with waves from the willowing extremities
of nausea.

With an immense effort of will and faith he simply let go
and pushed.

He felt himself float. Away. And then, counter-intuitively,
upwards. And upwards.

He threw his shoulders back, let his arms drop, gazed upwards
and let himself be drawn loosely, higher and higher.

Before long, insofar as such terms had any meaning in this
virtual universe, a ledge loomed up ahead of him on which he
could grip and on to which he could clamber.

He rose, he gripped, he clambered.

He panted a little. This was all a little stressful.

He held tightly on to the ledge as he sat. He wasn't certain if
this was to prevent himself from falling down off it or rising up
from it, but he needed something to grip on to as he surveyed
the world in which he found himself.

The whirling, turning height span him and twisted his brain
in upon itself till he found himself, eyes closed, whimpering and
hugging the hideous wall of towering rock.

He slowly brought his breathing back under control again.
He told himself repeatedly that he was just in a graphic rep-
resentation of a world. A virtual universe. A simulated reality.
He could snap back out of it at any moment.

He snapped back out of it.

He was sitting in a blue leatherette foam filled swivel-seated
office chair in front of a computer terminal.

He relaxed.

He was clinging to the face of an impossibly high peak perched
on a narrow ledge above a drop of brain-swivelling dimensions.

It wasn't just the landscape being so far beneath him -
he wished it would stop undulating and waving.

He had to get a grip. Not on the rock wall - that was an
illusion. He had to get a grip on the situation, be able to look
at the physical world he was in while drawing himself out of it
emotionally.

He clenched inwardly and then, just as he had let go of the
rock face itself, he let go of the idea of the rock face and let
himself just sit there clearly and freely. He looked out at the
world. He was breathing well. He was cool. He was in charge
again.

He was in a four-dimensional topological model of the Guide's
financial systems, and somebody or something would very shortly
want to know why.

And here they came.

Swooping through virtual space towards him came a small
flock of mean and steely-eyed creatures with pointy little heads,
pencil moustaches and querulous demands as to who he was,
what he was doing there, what his authorisation was, what the
authorisation of his authorising agent was, what his inside leg
measurement was and so on. Laser light flickered all over him
as if he was a packet of biscuits at a supermarket check-out. The
heavier duty laser guns were held, for the moment, in reserve.
The fact that all of this was happening in virtual space made no
difference. Being virtually killed by a virtual laser in virtual space
is just as effective as the real thing, because you are as dead as
you think you are.

The laser readers were becoming very agitated as they flickered
over his fingerprints, his retina and the follicle pattern where his
hair line was receding. They didn't like what they were finding at
all. The chattering and screeching of highly personal and insolent
questions was rising in pitch. A little surgical steel scraper was
reaching out towards the skin at the nape of his neck when
Ford, holding his breath and praying very slightly, pulled Vann
Harl's Ident-i-Eeze out of his pocket and waved it in front of
them.

Instantly every laser was diverted to the little card and Swept
backwards and forwards over it and in it, examining and reading
every molecule.

Then, just as suddenly, they stopped.

The entire flock of little virtual inspectors snapped to attention.

Nice to see you, Mr Harl,' they said in smarmy unison.
Is there anything we can do for you?'

Ford smiled a slow and vicious smile.

Do you know,' he said, I rather think there is?'
 Five minutes later he was out of there.

About thirty seconds to do the job, and three minutes thirty
to cover his tracks. He could have done anything he liked in
the virtual structure, more or less. He could have transferred
ownership of the entire organisation into his own name, but he
doubted if that would have gone unnoticed. He didn't want it
anyway. It would have meant responsibility, working late nights
at the office, not to mention massive and time-consuming fraud
investigations and a fair amount of time in jail. He wanted
something that nobody other than the computer would notice:
that was the bit that took thirty seconds.

The thing that took three minutes thirty was programming
the computer not to notice that it had noticed anything.

It had to want not to know about what Ford was up to, and
then he could safely leave the computer to rationalise its own
defences against the information ever emerging. It was a pro-
gramming technique that had been reverse-engineered from the
sort of psychotic mental blocks that otherwise perfectly normal
people had been observed invariably to develop when elected to
high political office.

The other minute was spent discovering that the computer
system already had a mental block. A big one.

He would never have discovered it if he hadn't been busy
engineering a mental block himself. He came across a whole
slew of smooth and plausible denial procedures and diversionary
subroutines exactly where he had been planning to install his
own. The computer denied all knowledge of them, of course,
then blankly refused to accept that there was anything even to
deny knowledge of, and was generally so convincing that even
Ford almost found himself thinking he must have made a mistake.

He was impressed.

He was so impressed, in fact, that he didn't bother to install
his own mental block procedures, he just set up calls to the ones
that were already there, which then called themselves when ques-
tioned, and so on.

He quickly set about debugging the little bits of code he had
installed himself, only to discover they weren't there. Cursing,
he searched all over for them, but could find no trace of them
at all.

He was just about to start installing them all over again when
he realised that the reason he couldn't find them was that they
were working already.

He grinned with satisfaction.

He tried to discover what the computer's other mental block
was all about, but it seemed, not unnaturally, to have a mental
block about it. He could no longer find any trace of it at all, in
fact; it was that good. He wondered if he had been imagining
it. He wondered if he had been imagining that it was something
to do with something in the building, and something to do with
the number . He ran a few tests. Yes, he had obviously been
imagining it.
 No time for fancy routes now, there was obviously a major
security alert in progress. Ford took the elevator up to the ground
floor to change to the express elevators. He had somehow to get
the Ident-i-Eeze back into Harl's pocket before it was missed.
How, he didn't know.

The doors of the elevator slid open to reveal a large posse of
security guards and robots poised waiting for it and brandishing
filthy looking weapons.

They ordered him out.

With a shrug he stepped forward. They all pushed rudely
past him into the elevator which took them down to continue
their search for him on the lower levels.

This was fun, thought Ford, giving Colin a friendly pat.
Colin was about the first genuinely useful robot Ford had ever
encountered. Colin bobbed along in the air in front of him in a
lather of cheerful ecstasy. Ford was glad he'd named him after
a dog.

He was highly tempted just to leave at that point and hope
for the best, but he knew that the best had a far greater chance
of actually occurring if Harl did not discover that his Ident-i-Eeze
was missing. He had somehow, surreptitiously, to return it.

They went to the express elevators.

Hi,' said the elevator they got into.

Hi,' said Ford.

Where can I take you folks today?' said the elevator.

Floor ,' said Ford.

Seems to be a popular floor today,' said the elevator.

Hmm,' thought Ford, not liking the sound of that at all.
The elevator lit up the twenty-third floor on its floor display
and started to zoom upwards. Something about the floor display
tweaked at Ford's mind but he couldn't catch what it was and
forgot about it. He was more worried about the idea of the floor
he was going to being a popular one. He hadn't really thought
through how he was going to deal with whatever it was that was
happening up there because he had no idea what he was going
to find. He would just have to busk it.

They were there.

The doors slid open.

Ominous quiet.

Empty corridor.

There was the door to Harl's office, with a slight layer of
dust around it. Ford knew that this dust consisted of billions of
tiny molecular robots that had crawled out of the woodwork,
built each other, rebuilt the door , disassembled each other and
then crept back into the woodwork again and just waited for
damage. Ford wondered what kind of life that was, but not for
long because he was a lot more concerned about what his own
life was like at that moment.

He took a deep breath and started his run.

Arthur felt at a bit of a loss. There was a whole Galaxy of stuff
out there for him, and he wondered if it was churlish of him to
complain to himself that it lacked just two things: the world he
was born on and the woman he loved.

Damn it and blast it, he thought, and felt the need of some
guidance and advice. He consulted the Hitch Hiker's Guide to
the Galaxy. He looked up guidance' and it said See under
ADVICE'. He looked up advice' and it said see under GUIDANCE'.
It had been doing a lot of that kind of stuff recently and
he wondered if it was all it was cracked up to be.

He headed to the outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy where, it
was said, wisdom and truth were to be found, most particularly
on the planet Hawalius, which was a planet of oracles and seers
and soothsayers and also take-away pizza shops, because most
mystics were completely incapable of cooking for themselves.

However it appeared that some sort of calamity had befallen
this planet. As Arthur wandered the streets of the village where
the major prophets lived, it had something of a crestfallen air.
He came across one prophet who was clearly shutting up shop
in a despondent kind of way and asked him what was happening.

No call for us any more,' he said gruffly as he started to
bang a nail into the plank he was holding across the window of
his hovel.

Oh? Why's that?'

Hold on to the other end of this and I'll show you.'

Arthur held up the unnailed end of the plank and the old
prophet scuttled into the recesses of his hovel, returning a
moment or two later with a small Sub-Etha radio. He turned it
on, fiddled with the dial for a moment and put the thing on the
small wooden bench that he usually sat and prophesied on. He
then took hold of the plank again and resumed hammering.

Arthur sat and listened to the radio.

...be confirmed,' said the radio.

Tomorrow,' it continued, the Vice-President of Poffla Vigus,
Roopy Ga Stip, will announce that he intends to run for Presi-
dent. In a speech he will give tomorrow at...'

Find another channel,' said the prophet. Arthur pushed the
preset button.

...refused to Comment,' said the radio. Next week's jobless
totals in the Zabush sector, it continued, will be the worst since
records began. A report published next month says...'

Find another,' barked the prophet, crossly. Arthur pushed
the button again.

...denied it categorically,' said the radio. Next month's
Royal Wedding between Prince Gid of the Soofling Dynasty
and Princess Hooli of Raui Alpha will be the most spectacular
ceremony the Bjanjy Territories has ever witnessed. Our reporter
Trillian Astra is there and sends us this report.'

Arthur blinked.

The sound of cheering crowds and a hubbub of brass bands
erupted from the radio. A very familiar voice said, Well Krart,
the scene here in the middle of next month is absolutely incred-
ible. Princess Hooli is looking radiant in a...'

The prophet swiped the radio off the bench and on to the
dusty ground, where it squawked like a badly tuned chicken.

See what we have to contend with?' grumbled the prophet.
Here, hold this. Not that, this. No, not like that. This way up.
Other way round, you fool.'
 I was listening to that,' complained Arthur, grappling help-
lessly with the prophet's hammer.

So does everybody. That's why this place is like a ghost
town.' He spat into the dust.

No, I mean, that sounded like someone I knew.'

Princess Hooli? If I had to stand around saying hello to
everybody who's known Princess Hooli I'd need a new set of
lungs.'

Not the Princess,' said Arthur. The reporter. Her name's
Trillian. I don't know where she got the Astra from. She's from
the same planet as me. I wondered where she'd got to.'

Oh, she's all over the continuum these days. We can't get
the tri-d TV stations out here of course, thank the Great Green
Arkleseizure, but you hear her on the radio, gallivanting here
and there through space time. She wants to settle down and find
herself a steady era that young lady does. It'll all end in tears.
Probably already has.' He swung with his hammer and hit his
thumb rather hard. He started to speak in tongues.
 The village of oracles wasn't much better.

He had been told that when looking for a good oracle it
was best to find the oracle that other oracles went to, but he
was shut. There was a sign by the entrance saying, I just don't
know any more. Try next door, but that's just a suggestion, not
formal oracular advice.'

Next door' was a cave a few hundred yards away and Arthur
walked towards it. Smoke and steam were rising from, respec-
tively, a small fire and a battered tin pot that was hanging over
it. There was also a very nasty smell coming from the pot. At
least Arthur thought it was coming from the pot. The distended
bladders of some of the local goat-like things were hanging from
a propped-up line drying in the sun, and the smell could have been
coming from them. There was also, a worryingly small distance
away, a pile of discarded bodies of the local goat-like things and
the smell could have been coming from them.

But the smell could just as easily have been coming from
the old lady who was busy beating flies away from the pile
of bodies. It was a hopeless task because each of the flies was
about the size of a winged bottle top and all she had was a table
tennis bat. Also she seemed half blind. Every now and then, by
chance, her wild thrashing would connect with one of the flies
with a richly satisfying thunk, and the fly would hurtle through
the air and smack itself open against the rock face a few yards
from the entrance to her cave.

She gave every impression, by her demeanour, that these
were the moments she lived for.

Arthur watched this exotic performance for a while from
a polite distance, and then at last tried giving a gentle cough
to attract her attention. The gentle cough, courteously meant,
unfortunately involved first inhaling rather more of the local
atmosphere than he had so far been doing and as a result, he
erupted into a fit of raucous expectoration, and collapsed against
the rock face, choking and streaming with tears. He struggled for
breath, but each new breath made things worse. He vomited,
half-choked again, rolled over his vomit, kept rolling for a few
yards, and eventually made it up on to his hands and knees and
crawled, panting, into slightly fresher air.

Excuse me,' he said. He got some breath back. I really
am most dreadfully sorry. I feel a complete idiot and...' He
gestured helplessly towards the small pile of his own vomit lying
spread around the entrance to her cave.

What can I say?' he said. What can I possibly say?'

This at least had gained her attention. She looked round
at him suspiciously, but, being half blind, had difficulty finding
him in the blurred and rocky landscape.

He waved, helpfully. Hello!' he called.

At last she spotted him, grunted to herself and turned back
to whacking flies.

It was horribly apparent from the way that currents of air
moved when she did, that the major source of the smell was
in fact her. The drying bladders, the festering bodies and the
noxious potage may all have been making violent contributions
to the atmosphere, but the major olfactory presence was the
woman herself.

She got another good thwack at a fly. It smacked against
the rock and dribbled its insides down it in what she clearly
regarded, if she could see that far, as a satisfactory manner.

Unsteadily, Arthur got to his feet and brushed himself down
with a fistful of dried grass. He didn't know what else to do by
way of announcing himself. He had half a mind just to wander
off again, but felt awkward about leaving a pile of his vomit
in front of the entrance to the woman's home. He wondered
what to do about it. He started to pluck up more handsful
of the scrubby dried grass that was to be found here and
there. He was worried, though, that if he ventured nearer
to the vomit he might simply add to it rather than clear it
up.

Just as he was debating with himself as to what the right
course of action was he began to realise that she was at last
saying something to him.

I beg your pardon?' he called out.

I said, can I help you?' she said, in a thin, scratchy voice.
that he could only just hear.

Er, I came to ask your advice,' he called back, feeling
a bit ridiculous.

She turned to peer at him, myopically, then turned back,
swiped at a fly and missed.

What about?' she said.

I beg your pardon?' he said.

I said, what about?' she almost screeched.

Well,' said Arthur. Just sort of general advice, really. It
said in the brochure -'

Ha! Brochure!' spat the old woman. She seemed to be
waving her bat more or less at random now.

Arthur fished the crumpled-up brochure from his pocket.
He wasn't quite certain why. He had already read it and she,
he expected, wouldn't want to. He unfolded it anyway in order
to have something to frown thoughtfully at for a moment or
two. The copy in the brochure wittered on about the ancient
mystical arts of the seers and sages of Hawalius, and wild-
ly over-represented the level of accommodation available in
Hawalion. Arthur still carried a copy of The Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy with him but found, when he consulted
it, that the entries were becoming more abstruse and paranoid. Something was wrong
somewhere. Whether it was in his own personal unit, or whether
it was something or someone going terribly amiss, or perhaps just
hallucinating, at the heart of the Guide organisation itself, he
didn't know. But one way or another he was even less inclined
to trust it than usual, which meant that he trusted it not one
bit, and mostly used it for eating his sandwiches off when he
was sitting on a rock staring at something.

The woman had turned and was walking slowly towards him
now. Arthur tried, without making it too obvious, to judge the
wind direction, and bobbed about a bit as she approached.

Advice,' she said. Advice, eh?'

Er, yes,' said Arthur. Yes, that is -'

He frowned again at the brochure, as if to be certain that
he hadn't misread it and stupidly turned up on the wrong planet
or something. The brochure said The friendly local inhabitants
will be glad to share with you the knowledge and wisdom of
the ancients. Peer with them into the swirling mysteries of past
and future time!' There were some coupons as well, but Arthur
had been far too embarrassed actually to cut them out or try to
present them to anybody.

Advice, eh,' said the old woman again. Just sort of general
advice, you say. On what? What to do with your life, that sort
of thing?'

Yes,' said Arthur. That sort of thing. Bit of a problem I
sometimes find if I'm being perfectly honest.' He was trying
desperately, with tiny darting movements, to stay upwind of
her. She surprised him by suddenly turning sharply away from
him and heading off towards her cave.

You'll have to help me with the photocopier, then,' she said.

What?' said Arthur.

The photocopier,' she repeated, patiently. You'll have to
help me drag it out. It's solar-powered. I have to keep it in
the cave, though, so the birds don't shit on it.'

I see,' said Arthur.

I'd take a few deep breaths if I were you,' muttered the
old woman, as she stomped into the gloom of the cave mouth.

Arthur did as she advised. He almost hyperventilated in fact.
When he felt he was ready, he held his breath and followed her
in.

The photocopier was a big old thing on a rickety trolley.
It stood just inside the dim shadows of the cave. The wheels
were stuck obstinately in different directions and the ground
was rough and stony.

Go ahead and take a breath outside,' said the old woman.
Arthur was going red in the face trying to help her move the
thing.

He nodded in relief. If she wasn't going to be embarrassed
about it then neither, he was determined, would he. He stepped
outside and took a few breaths, then came back in to do more
heaving and pushing. He had to do this quite a few times till at
last the machine was outside.

The sun beat down on it. The old woman disappeared back
into her cave again and brought with her some mottled metal
panels, which she connected to the machine to collect the sun's
energy.

She squinted up into the sky. The sun was quite bright,
but the day was hazy and vague.

It'll take a while,' she said.

Arthur said he was happy to wait.

The old woman shrugged and stomped across to the fire.
Above it, the contents of the tin can were bubbling away. She
poked about at them with a stick.

You won't be wanting any lunch?' she enquired of Arthur.

I've eaten, thanks,' said Arthur. No, really. I've eaten.'

I'm sure you have,' said the old lady. She stirred with
the stick. After a few minutes she fished a lump of some-
thing out, blew on it to cool it a little, and then put it in
her mouth.

She chewed on it thoughtfully for a bit.

Then she hobbled slowly across to the pile of dead goat-like
things. She spat the lump out on to the pile. She hobbled slowly
back to the can. She tried to unhook it from the sort of tripod-like
thing that it was hanging from.

Can I help you?' said Arthur, jumping up politely. He hurried
over.

Together they disengaged the tin from the tripod and carried
it awkwardly down the slight slope that led downwards from her
cave and towards a line of scrubby and gnarled trees, which
marked the edge of a steep but quite shallow gully, from, which
a whole new range of offensive smells was emanating.

Ready?' said the old Lady.

Yes...' said Arthur, though he didn't know for what.

One,' said the old lady.

Two,' she said.

Three,' she added.

Arthur realised just in time what she intended. Together
they tossed the contents of the tin into the gully.

After an hour or two of uncommunicative silence, the old
woman decided that the solar panels had absorbed enough
sunlight to run the photocopier now and she disappeared to
rummage inside her cave. She emerged at last with a few sheaves
of paper and fed them through the machine.

She handed the copies to Arthur.

This is, er, this your advice then, is it?' said Arthur, leafing
through them uncertainly.

No,' said the old lady. It's the story of my life. You see,
the quality of any advice anybody has to offer has to be judged
against the quality of life they actually lead. Now, as you look
through this document you'll see that I've underlined all the major
decisions I ever made to make them stand out. They're all indexed
and cross-referenced. See? All I can suggest is that if you take
decisions that are exactly opposite to the sort of decisions that
I've taken, then maybe you won't finish up at the end of your
life...' she paused, and filled her lungs for a good shout, ...
in a smelly old cave like this!'

She grabbed up her table tennis bat, rolled up her sleeve,
stomped off to her pile of dead goat-like things, and started
to set about the flies with vim and vigour.
 The last village Arthur visited consisted entirely of extremely
high poles. They were so high that it wasn't possible to tell,
from the ground, what was on top of them, and Arthur had to
climb three before he found one that had anything on top of it
at all other than a platform covered with bird droppings.

Not an easy task. You went up the poles by climbing on
the short wooden pegs that had been hammered into them in
slowly ascending spirals. Anybody who was a less diligent tourist
than Arthur would have taken a couple of snapshots and sloped
right off to the nearest Bar and Grill, where you also could buy a
range of particularly sweet and gooey chocolate cakes to eat in
front of the ascetics. But, largely as a result of this, most of the
ascetics had gone now. In fact they had mostly gone and set up
lucrative therapy centres on some of the more affluent worlds
in the North West ripple of the Galaxy, where the living was
easier by a factor of about seventeen million, and the chocolate
was just fabulous. Most of the ascetics, it turned out, had not
known about chocolate before they took up asceticism. Most of
the clients who came to their therapy centres knew about it all
too well.

At the top of the third pole Arthur stopped for a breather. He
was very hot and out of breath, since each pole was about fifty or
sixty feet high. The world seemed to swing vertiginously around
him, but it didn't worry Arthur too much. He knew that, logically.
he could not die until he had been to Stavromula Beta , and had
therefore managed to cultivate a merry attitude towards extreme
personal danger. He felt a little giddy perched fifty feet up in the
air on top of a pole, but he dealt with it by eating a sandwich. He
was just about to embark on reading the photocopied life history
of the oracle, when he was rather startled to hear a slight cough
behind him.

He turned so abruptly that he dropped his sandwich, which
turned downwards through the air and was rather small by the
time it was stopped by the ground.

About thirty feet behind Arthur was another pole, and, alone
amongst the sparse forest of about three dozen poles, the top of
it was occupied. It was occupied by an old man who, in turn,
seemed to be occupied by profound thoughts that were making
him scowl.

Excuse me,' said Arthur. The man ignored him. Perhaps he
couldn't hear him. The breeze was moving about a bit. It was
only by chance that Arthur had heard the slight cough.

Hello?' called Arthur. Hello!'

The man at last glanced round at him. He seemed surprised
to see him. Arthur couldn't tell if he was surprised and pleased
to see him or just surprsised.

Are you open?' called Arthur.

The man frowned in incomprehension. Arthur couldn't tell
if he couldn't understand or couldn't hear.

He clambered off the small platform and climbed quickly
down the spiralling pegs, arriving at the bottom quite dizzy.

He started to make his way over to the pole on which
the old man was sitting, and then suddenly realised that he
had disoriented himself on the way down and didn't know for
certain which one it was.

He looked around for landmarks and worked out which was
the right one.

He climbed it. It wasn't.

Damn,' he said. Excuse me!' he called out to the old man
again, who was now straight in front of him and forty feet away.
Got lost. Be with you in a minute.' Down he went again, getting
very hot and bothered.

When he arrived, panting and sweating, at the top of the
pole that he knew for certain was the right one he realised that
the man was, somehow or other, mucking him about.

What do you want?' shouted the old man crossly at him. He
was now sitting on top of the pole that Arthur recognised was
the one that he had been on himself when eating his sandwich.

How did you get over there?' called Arthur in bewilder-
ment.

You think I'm going to tell you just like that what it took
me forty springs, summers and autumns of sitting on top of a
pole to work out?'

What about winter?'

What about winter?'

Don't you sit on the pole in the winter?'

Just because I sit up a pole for most of my life,' said the
man, doesn't mean I'm an idiot. I go south in the winter. Got
a beach house. Sit on the chimney stack.'

Do you have any advice for a traveller?'

Yes. Get a beach house.'

I see.'

The man stared out over the hot, dry scrubby landscape.
From here Arthur could just see the old woman, a tiny speck
in the distance, dancing up and down swatting flies.

You see her?' called the old man, suddenly.

Yes,' said Arthur. I consulted her in fact.'

Fat lot she knows. I got the beach house because she turned
it down. What advice did she give you?'

Do exactly the opposite of everything she's done.'

In other words, get a beach house.'

I suppose so,' said Arthur. Well, maybe I'll get one.'

Hmmm.'

The horizon was swimming in a fetid heat haze.

Any other advice?' asked Arthur. Other than to do with
real estate?'

A beach house isn't just real estate. It's a state of mind,'
said the man. He turned and looked at Arthur.

Oddly, the man's face was now only a couple of feet away.
He seemed in one way to be a perfectly normal shape, but his
body was sitting cross-legged on a pole forty feet away while his
face was only two feet from Arthur's. Without moving his head,
and without seeming to do anything odd at all, he stood up and
stepped on to the top of another pole. Either it was just the heat,
thought Arthur, or space was a different shape for him.

A beach house,' he said, doesn't even have to be on the
beach. Though the best ones are. We all like to congregate,'
he went on, at boundary conditions.'

Really?' said Arthur.

Where land meets water. Where earth meets air. Where
body meets mind. Where space meets time. We like to be
on one side, and look at the other.'

Arthur got terribly excited. This was exactly the sort of
thing he'd been promised in the brochure. Here was a man who
seemed to be moving through some kind of Escher space saying
really profound things about all sorts of stuff.

It was unnerving though. The man was now stepping from
pole to ground, from ground to pole, from pole to pole, from
pole to horizon and back: he was making complete nonsense of
Arthur's spatial universe. Please stop!' Arthur said, suddenly.

Can't take it, huh?' said the man. Without the slightest
movement he was now back, sitting cross-legged, on top of the
pole forty feet in front of Arthur. You come to me for advice,
but you can't cope with anything you don't recognise. Hmmm.
So we'll have to tell you something you already know but make
it sound like news, eh? Well, business as usual I suppose.' He
sighed and squinted mournfully into the distance.

Where you from, boy?' he then asked.
Arthur decided to be clever. He was fed up with being
mistaken for a complete idiot by everyone he ever met. Tell
you what,' he said. You're a seer. Why don't you tell me?'

The old man sighed again. I was just,' he said, passing his
hand round behind his head, making conversation.' When he
brought his hand round to the front again, he had a globe of the
Earth spinning on his up-pointed forefinger. It was unmistakable.
He put it away again. Arthur was stunned.

How did you -'

I can't tell you.'

Why not? I've come all this way.'
You cannot see what I see because you see what you see.
You cannot know what I know because you know what you
know. What I see and what I know cannot be added to what
you see and what you know because they are not of the same
kind. Neither can it replace what you see and what you know,
because that would be to replace you yourself.'

Hang on, can I write this down?' said Arthur, excitedly
fumbling in his pocket for a pencil.

You can pick up a copy at the spaceport,' said the old
man . They've got racks of the stuff.'

Oh,' said Arthur, disappointed. Well, isn't there anything
that's perhaps a bit more specific to me?'

Everything you see or hear or experience in any way at
all is specific to you. You create a universe by perceiving it,
so everything in the universe you perceive is specific to you.'

Arthur looked at him doubtfully. Can I get that at the
spaceport, too?' he said.

Check it out,' said the old man.

It says in the brochure,' said Arthur, pulling it out of his
pocket and looking at it again, that I can have a special prayer,
individually tailored to me and my special needs.'

Oh, all right,' said the old man. Here's a prayer for you.
Got a pencil?'

Yes,' said Arthur.

It goes like this. Let's see now: Protect me from knowing what
I don't need to know. Protect me from even knowing that there
are things to know that I don't know. Protect me from knowing
that I decided not to know about the things that I decided not to
know about. Amen.'' That's it. It's what you pray silently inside
yourself anyway, so you may as well have it out in the open.'

Hmmm,' said Arthur. Well, thank you -'

There's another prayer that goes with it that's very impor-
tant,' continued the old man, so you'd better jot this down,
too.'

OK.'

It goes, Lord, lord, lord...'' It's best to put that bit
in, just in case. You can never be too sure Lord, lord, lord.
Protect me from the consequences of the above prayer. Amen...''
And that's it. Most of the trouble people get into in life comes
from missing out that last part.'

Ever heard of a place called Stavromula Beta?' asked Arthur.

No.'

Well, thank you for your help,' said Arthur.

Don't mention it,' said the man on the pole, and vanished.

Ford hurled himself at the door of the editor-in-chief's office,
tucked himself into a tight ball as the frame splintered and gave
way once again, rolled rapidly across the floor to where the smart
grey crushed leather sofa was and set up his strategic operational
base behind it.

That, at least, was the plan.

Unfortunately the smart grey crushed leather sofa wasn't there.

Why, thought Ford, as he twisted himself round in mid-air,
lurched, dived and scuttled for cover behind Harl's desk, did
people have this stupid obsession with rearranging their office
furniture every five minutes?

Why, for instance, replace a perfectly serviceable if rather
muted grey crushed leather sofa with what appeared to be a
small tank?

And who was the big guy with the mobile rocket launcher
on his shoulder? Someone from head office? Couldn't be. This
was head office. At least it was the head office of the Guide.
Where these InfiniDim Enterprises guys came from Zarquon
knew. Nowhere very sunny, judging from the slug-like colour
and texture of their skins. This was all wrong, thought Ford.
People connected with the Guide should come from sunny
places.

There were several of them, in fact, and all of them seemed
to be more heavily armed and armoured than you normally
expected corporate executives to be, even in today's rough and
tumble business world.

He was making a lot of assumptions here, of course. He
was assuming that the big, bull-necked, slug-like guys were
in some way connected with InfiniDim Enterprises, but it was
a reasonable assumption and he felt happy about it because
they had logos on their armour-plating which said InfiniDim
Enterprises' on them. He had a nagging suspicion that this was
not a business meeting, though. He also had a nagging feeling
that these slug-like creatures were familiar to him in some way.
Familiar, but in an unfamiliar guise.

Well, he had been in the room for a good two and a half
seconds now, and thought that it was probably about time to
start doing something constructive. He could take a hostage.
That would be good.

Vann Harl was in his swivel chair, looking alarmed, pale
and shaken. Had probably had some bad news as well as a
nasty bang to the back of his head. Ford leapt to his feet and
made a running grab for him.
 Under the pretext of getting him into a good solid double
underpinned elbow-lock, Ford managed surreptitiously to slip
the Ident-i-Eeze back into Harl's inner pocket.

Bingo!

He'd done what he came to do. Now he just had to talk
his way out of here.

OK,' he said. I...' He paused.

The big guy with the rocket launcher was turning towards
Ford Prefect and pointing it at him, which Ford couldn't help
feeling was wildly irresponsible behaviour.

I...' he started again, and then on a sudden impulse
decided to duck.

There was a deafening roar as flames leapt from the back
of the rocket launcher and a rocket leapt from its front.

The rocket hurtled past Ford and hit the large plate-glass
window, which billowed outwards in a shower of a million
shards under the force of the explosion. Huge shock waves of
noise and air pressure reverberated around the room, sweeping
a couple of chairs, a filing cabinet and Colin the security robot
out of the window.

Ah! So they're not totally rocket-proof after all, thought Ford
Prefect to himself. Someone should have a word with somebody
about that. He disentangled himself from Harl and tried to work
out which way to run.

He was surrounded.

The big guy with the rocket launcher was moving it up
into position for another shot.
Ford was completely at a loss for what to do next.

Look,' he said in a stern voice. But he wasn't certain how far
saying things like Look' in a stern voice was necessarily going to
get him, and time was not on his side. What the hell, he thought,
you're only young once, and threw himself out of the window.
That would at least keep the element of surprise on his side.

The first thing Arthur Dent had to do, he realised resignedly,
was to get himself a life. This meant he had to find a planet
he could have one on. It had to be a planet he could breathe
on, where he could stand up and sit down without experiencing
gravitational discomfort. It had to be somewhere where the acid
levels were low and the plants didn't actually attack you.

I hate to be anthropic about this,' he said to the strange
thing behind the desk at the Resettlement Advice Centre on
Pintleton Alpha, but I'd quite like to live somewhere where
the people look vaguely like me as well. You know. Sort of
human.'

The strange thing behind the desk waved some of its stranger
bits around and seemed rather taken aback by this. It oozed and
glopped off its seat, thrashed its way slowly across the floor,
ingested the old metal filing cabinet and then, with a great
belch, excreted the appropriate drawer. It popped out a couple
of glistening tentacles from its ear, removed some files from the
drawer, sucked the drawer back in and vomited up the cabinet
again. It thrashed its way back across the floor, slimed its way
back up on to the seat and slapped the files on the table.

See anything you fancy?' it asked.

Arthur looked nervously through some grubby and damp
pieces of paper. He was definitely in some backwater part of
the Galaxy here, and somewhere off to the left as far as the
universe he knew and recognised was concerned. In the space
where his own home should have been there was a rotten hick
planet, drowned with rain and inhabited by thugs and boghogs.
Even The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy seemed to work
only fitfully here, which was why he was reduced to making these
sorts of enquiries in these sorts of places. One place he always
asked after was Stavromula Beta, but no one had ever heard of
such a planet.

The available worlds looked pretty grim. They had little
to offer him because he had little to offer them. He had
been extremely chastened to realise that although he originally
came from a world which had cars and computers and ballet and
armagnac he didn't, by himself, know how any of it worked. He
couldn't do it. Left to his own devices he couldn't build a toaster.
He could just about make a sandwich and that was it. There was
not a lot of demand for his services.

Arthur's heart sank. This surprised him, because he thought
it was already about as low as it could possibly be. He closed
his eyes for a moment. He so much wanted to be home. He
so much wanted his own home world, the actual Earth he had
grown up on, not to have been demolished. He so much wanted
none of this to have happened. He so much wanted that when he
opened his eyes again he would be standing on the doorstep of his
little cottage in the west country of England, that the sun would
be shining over the green hills, the post van would be going up
the lane, the daffodils would be blooming in his garden, and in
the distance the pub would be opening for lunch. He so much
wanted to take the newspaper down to the pub and read it over
a pint of bitter. He so much wanted to do the crossword. He so
much wanted to be able to get completely stuck on across.

He opened his eyes.

The strange thing was pulsating irritably at him, tapping
some kind of pseudopodia on the desk.

Arthur shook his head and looked at the next sheet of paper.

Grim, he thought. And the next.

Very grim. And the next.

Oh... Now that looked better.

It was a world called Bartledan. It had oxygen. It had green
hills. It even, it seemed, had a renowned literary culture. But
the thing that most aroused his interest was a photograph of a
small bunch of Bartledanian people, standing around in a village
square, smiling pleasantly at the camera.

Ah,' he said, and held the picture up to the strange thing
behind the desk.

Its eyes squirmed out on stalks and roiled up and down
the piece of paper, leaving a glistening trail of slime all over
it.

Yes,' it said with distaste. They do look exactly like you.'
 Arthur moved to Bartledan and, using some money he had
made by selling some toenail clippings and spit to a DNA
bank, he bought himself a room in the village featured in the
picture. It was pleasant there. The air was balmy. The people
looked like him and seemed not to mind him being there. They
didn't attack him with anything. He bought some clothes and a
cupboard to put them in.

He had got himself a life. Now he had to find a purpose in it.

At first he tried to sit and read. But the literature of Bartledan,
famed though it was throughout this sector of the Galaxy for its
subtlety and grace, didn't seem to be able to sustain his interest.
The problem was that it wasn't actually about human beings after
all. It wasn't about what human beings wanted. The people of
Bartledan were remarkably like human beings to look at, but
when you said Good evening' to one, he would tend to look
around with a slight sense of surprise, sniff the air and say that,
yes, he supposed that it probably was a goodish evening now that
Arthur came to mention it.

No, what I meant was to wish you a good evening,' Arthur
would say, or rather, used to say. He soon learned to avoid these
conversations. I mean that I hope you have a good evening,' he
would add.

More puzzlement.

Wish?' the Bartledanian would say at last, in polite bafflement.

Er, yes,' Arthur would then have said. I'm just expressing
the hope that...'

Hope?'

Yes.'

What is hope?'

Good question, thought Arthur to himself, and retreated
back to his room to think about things.

On the one hand he could only recognise and respect what he
learnt about the Bartledanian view of the universe, which was
that the universe was what the universe was, take it or leave it.
On the other hand he could not help but feel that not to desire
anything, not ever to. wish or to hope, was just not natural.

Natural. There was a tricky word.

He had long ago realised that a lot of things that he had
thought of as natural, like buying people presents at Christmas,
stopping at red lights or falling at a rate of feet second second,
were just the habits of his own world and didn't necessarily work
the same way anywhere else; but not to wish - that really couldn't
be natural, could it? That would be like not breathing.

Breathing was another thing that the Bartledanians didn't
do, despite all the oxygen in the atmosphere. They just stood
there. Occasionally they ran around and played netball and stuff
(without ever wishing to win though, of course - they would just
play, and whoever won, won), but they never actually breathed.
It was, for some reason, unnecessary. Arthur quickly learned
that playing netball with them was just too spooky. Though they
looked like humans, and even moved and sounded like humans,
they didn't breathe and they didn't wish for things.

Breathing and wishing for things, on the other hand, was
just about all that Arthur seemed to do all day. Sometimes
he would wish for things so much that his breathing would get
quite agitated, and he would have to go and lie down for a bit.
On his own. In his small room. So far from the world which had
given birth to him that his brain could not even process the sort
of numbers involved without just going limp.

He preferred not to think about it. He preferred just to sit
and read - or at least he would prefer it if there was anything
worth reading. But nobody in Bartledanian stories ever wanted
anything. Not even a glass of water. Certainly, they would fetch
one if they were thirsty, but if there wasn't one available, they
would think no more about it. He had just read an entire book
in which the main character had, over the course of a week, done
some work in his garden, played a great deal of netball, helped
mend a road, fathered a child on his wife and then unexpectedly
died of thirst just before the last chapter. In exasperation Arthur
had combed his way back through the book and in the end had
found a passing reference to some problem with the plumbing in
Chapter . And that was it. So the guy dies. It just happens.

It wasn't even the climax of the book, because there wasn't
one. The character died about a third of the way through the
penultimate chapter of the book, and the rest of it was just more
stuff about road-mending. The book just finished dead at the one
hundred thousandth word, because that was how long books were
on Bartledan.

Arthur threw the book across the room, sold the room and
left. He started to travel with wild abandon, trading in more
and more spit, toenails, fingernails, blood, hair, anything that
anybody wanted, for tickets. For semen, he discovered, he could
travel first class. He settled nowhere, but only existed in the
hermetic, twilight world of the cabins of hyperspatial starships,
eating, drinking, sleeping, watching movies, only stopping at
spaceports to donate more DNA and catch the next long-haul
ship out. He waited and waited for another accident to happen.

The trouble with trying to make the right accident happen
is that it won't. That is not what accident' means. The acci-
dent that eventually occurred was not what he had planned
at all. The ship he was on blipped in hyperspace, flickered
horribly between ninety-seven different points in the Galaxy
simultaneously, caught the unexpected gravitational pull of an
uncharted planet in one of them, became ensnared in its outer
atmosphere and began to fall, screaming and tearing, into it.

The ship's systems protested all the way down that everything
was perfectly normal and under control, but when it went into a
final hectic spin, ripped wildly through half a mile of trees and
finally exploded into a seething ball of flame it became clear that
this was not the case.

Fire engulfed the forest, boiled into the night, then neatly
put itself out, as all unscheduled fires over a certain size are
now required to do by law. For a short while afterwards, other
small fires flared up here and there as odd pieces of scattered
debris exploded quietly in their own time. Then they too died
away.

Arthur Dent, because of the sheer boredom of endless inter-
stellar flight, was the only one on board who had actually
familiarised himself with the ship's safety procedures in case
of an unscheduled landing, and was therefore the sole survivor.
He lay dazed, broken and bleeding in a sort of fluffy pink plastic
cocoon with Have a nice day' printed in over three thousand
different languages all over it.

Black, roaring silences swam sickeningly through his shattered
mind. He knew with a kind of resigned certainty that he would
survive, because he had not yet been to Stavromula Beta.

After what seemed an eternity of pain and darkness, he
became aware of quiet shapes moving around him.

Ford tumbled through the open air in a cloud of glass splinters
and chair parts. Again, he hadn't really thought things through,
really, and was just playing it by ear, buying time. At times of
major crisis he found it was often quite helpful to have his life
flash before his eyes. It gave him a chance to reflect on things,
see things in some sort of perspective, and it sometimes furnished
him with a vital clue as to what to do next.

There was the ground rushing up to meet him at feet
per second per second, but he would, he thought, deal with
that problem when he got to it. First things first.

Ah, here it came. His childhood. Hum drum stuff, he'd
been through it all before. Images flashed by. Boring times on
Betelgeuse Five. Zaphod Beeblebrox as a kid. Yes he knew all
that. He wished he had some kind of fast forward in his brain.
His seventh birthday party, being given his first towel. Come on,
come on.

He was twisting and turning downwards, the outside air at
this height a cold shock to his lungs. Trying not to inhale glass.

Early voyages to other planets. Oh for Zark's sake, this
was like some sort of bloody travelogue documentary before
the main feature. First beginning to work for the Guide.

Ah!

Those were the days. They worked out of a hut on the
Bwenelli Atoll on Fanalla before the Riktanarqals and the
Danqueds vertled it. Half a dozen guys, some towels, a handful
of highly sophisticated digital devices, and most importantly a
lot of dreams. No. Most importantly a lot of Fanallan rum. To
be completely accurate, that Ol' Janx Spirit was the absolute
most important thing, then the Fanallan rum, and also some of
the beaches on the Atoll where the local girls would hang out,
but the dreams were important as well. Whatever happened to
those?

He couldn't quite remember what the dreams were in fact,
but they had seemed immensely important at the time. They
had certainly not involved this huge towering office block he was
now falling down the side of. All of that had come when some of
the original team had started to settle down and get greedy, while
he and others had stayed out in the field, researching and hitch
hiking, and gradually becoming more and more isolated from the
corporate nightmare the Guide had inexorably turned into, and
the architectural monstrosity it had come to occupy. Where were
the dreams in that? He thought of all the corporate lawyers who
occupied half of the building, all the operatives' who occupied the
lower levels, and all the sub-editors and their secretaries and their
secretaries' lawyers and their secretaries' lawyers' secretaries, and
worst of all the accountants and the marketing department.

He had half a mind just to keep on falling. Two fingers
to the lot of them.

He was just passing the seventeenth floor now, where the
marketing department hung out. Load of tosspots all arguing
about what colour the Guide should be and exercising their
infinitely infallible skills of being wise after the event. If any of
them had chosen to look out of the window at that moment they
would have been startled by the sight of Ford Prefect dropping
past them to his certain death and flicking V-signs at them.

Sixteenth floor. Sub-editors. Bastards. What about all that
copy of his they'd cut? Fifteen years of research he'd filed
from one planet alone and they'd cut it to two words. Mostly
Harmless.' V-signs to them as well.

Fifteenth floor. Logistical Administration, whatever that was
about. They all had big cars. That, he thought, was what that
was about.

Fourteenth floor. Personnel. He had a very shrewd suspicion
that it was they who had engineered his fifteen-year exile while
the Guide metamorphosed into the corporate monolith (or
rather, duolith - mustn't forget the lawyers) it had become.

Thirteenth floor. Research and development.

Hang about.

Thirteenth floor.

He was having to think rather fast at the moment because
the situation was becoming a little urgent.

He suddenly remembered the floor display panel in the eleva-
tor. It hadn't had a thirteenth floor. He'd thought no more about
it because, having spent fifteen years on the rather backward
planet Earth where they were superstitious about the number
thirteen, he was used to being in buildings that numbered their
floors without it. No reason for that here, though.

The windows of the thirteenth floor, he could not help noticing
as he flashed swiftly by them, were darkened.

What was going on in there? He started to remember all
the stuff that Harl had been talking about. One, new, multi-
dimensional Guide spread across an infinite number of universes.
It had sounded, the way Harl had put it, like wild meaninglessness
dreamed up by the marketing department with the backing of the
accountants. If it was any more real than that then it was a very
weird and dangerous idea. Was it real? What was going on behind
the darkened windows of the sealed-off thirteenth floor?

Ford felt a rising sense of curiosity, and then a rising sense
of panic. That was the complete list of rising feelings he had. In
every other respect he was falling very rapidly. He really ought
to turn his mind to wondering how he was going to get out of
this situation alive.

He glanced down. A hundred feet or so below him people
were milling around, some of them beginning to look up expect-
antly. Clearing a space for him. Even temporarily calling off the
wonderful and completely fatuous hunt for wockets.
 He would hate to disappoint them, but about two feet below
him, he hadn't realised before, was Colin. Colin had obviously
been happily dancing attendance and waiting for him to decide
what he wanted to do.

Colin!' Ford bawled.

Colin didn't respond. Ford went cold. Then he suddenly
realised that he hadn't told Colin his name was Colin.

Come up here!' Ford bawled.

Colin bobbed up beside him. Colin was enjoying the ride
down immensely and hoped that Ford was, too.

Colin's world went unexpectedly dark as Ford's towel suddenly
enveloped him. Colin immediately felt himself get much, much
heavier. He was thrilled and delighted by the challenge that Ford
had presented him with. Just not sure if he could handle it, that
was all.

The towel was slung over Colin. Ford was hanging from the
towel, gripping to its seams. Other hitch hikers had seen fit to
modify their towels in exotic ways, weaving all kinds of esoteric
tools and utilities and even computer equipment into their fabric.
Ford was a purist. He liked to keep things simple. He carried
a regular towel from a regular domestic soft furnishings shop.
It even had a kind of blue and pink floral pattern despite his
repeated attempts to bleach and stone wash it. It had a couple
of pieces of wire threaded into it, a bit of flexible writing stick,
and also some nutrients soaked into one of the corners of the
fabric so he could suck it in an emergency, but otherwise it was
a simple towel you could dry your face on.

The only actual modification he had been persuaded by a
friend to make to it was to reinforce the seams.

Ford gripped the seams like a maniac.

They were still descending, but the rate had slowed.

Up, Colin!' he shouted.

Nothing.

Your name,' shouted Ford, is Colin. So when I shout Up,
Colin!'' I want you, Colin, to go up. OK? Up, Colin!'

Nothing. Or rather a sort of muffled groaning sound from
Colin. Ford was very anxious. They were descending very slow-
ly now, but Ford was very anxious about the sort of people he
could see assembling on the ground beneath him. Friendly,
local, wocket-hunting types were dispersing, and thick, heavy,
bull-necked, slug-like creatures with rocket launchers were, it
seemed, sliding out of what was usually called thin air. Thin
air, as all experienced Galactic travellers well know, is, in fact,
extremely thick with multi-dimensional complexities.

Up,' bellowed Ford again. Up! Colin, go up!'

Colin was straining and groaning. They were now more or
less stationary in the air. Ford felt as if his fingers were breaking.

Up!'

They stayed put.

Up, up, up!'

A slug was preparing to launch a rocket at him. Ford couldn't
believe it. He was hanging from a towel in mid-air and a slug
was preparing to fire rockets at him. He was running out of
anything he could think of doing and was beginning to get
seriously alarmed.

This was the sort of predicament that he usually relied on
having the Guide available for to give advice, however infuriating
or glib, but this was not a moment for reaching into his pocket.
And the Guide seemed to be no longer a friend and ally but was
now itself a source of danger. These were the Guide offices he
was hanging outside, for Zark's sake, in danger of his life from
the people who now appeared to own the thing. What had become
of all the dreams he vaguely remembered having on the Bwenelli
Atoll? They should have let it all be. They should have stayed
there. Stayed on the beach. Loved good women. Lived on fish.
He should have known it was all wrong the moment they started
hanging grand pianos over the sea-monster pool in the atrium.
He began to feel thoroughly wasted and miserable. His fingers
were on fire with clenched pain. And his ankle was still hurting.

Oh thank you, ankle, he thought to himself bitterly. Thank
you for bringing up your problems at this time. I expect you'd
like a nice warm footbath to make you feel better, wouldn't you?
Or at least you'd like me to...

He had an idea.

The armoured slug had hoisted the rocket launcher up on to
its shoulder. The rocket was presumably designed to hit anything
in its path that moved.

Ford tried not to sweat because he could feel his grip on
the seams of his towel slipping.

With the toe of his good foot he nudged and prised at
the heel of the shoe on his hurting foot.

Go up, damn you!' Ford muttered hopelessly to Colin, who
was cheerily straining away but unable to rise. Ford worked away
at the heel of his shoe.

He was trying to judge the timing, but there was no point.
Just go for it. He only had one shot and that was it. He had
now eased the back of his shoe down off his heel. His twisted
ankle felt a little better. Well that was good, wasn't it?

With his other foot he kicked at the heel of the shoe. It slipped
off his foot and fell through the air. About half a second later a
rocket erupted up from the muzzle of its launcher, encountered
the shoe falling through its path, went straight for it, hit it, and
exploded with a great sense of satisfaction and achievement.

This happened about fifteen feet from the ground.

The main force of the explosion was directed downwards.
Where, a second earlier, there had been a squad of InfiniDim
Enterprises executives with a rocket launcher standing on an
elegant terraced plaza paved with large slabs of lustrous stone
cut from the ancient alabastrum quarries of Zentalquabula there
was now, instead, a bit of a pit with nasty bits in it.

A great wump of hot air welled up from the explosion throwing
Ford and Colin violently up into the sky. Ford fought desperately
and blindly to hold on and failed. He turned helplessly upwards
through the sky, reached the peak of a parabola, paused and
then started to fall again. He fell and fell and fell and suddenly
winded himself badly on Colin, who was still rising.

He clasped himself desperately on to the small spherical
robot. Colin slewed wildly through the air towards the tower of
the Guide offices, trying delightedly to control himself and slow
down.

The world span sickeningly round Ford's head as they span
and twisted round each other and then, equally sickeningly,
everything suddenly stopped.

Ford found himself deposited dizzily on a window ledge.

His towel fell past and he grabbed at it and caught it.

Colin bobbed in the air inches away from him.

Ford looked around himself in a bruised, bleeding and breath-
less daze. The ledge was only about a foot wide and he was
perched precariously on it, thirteen stories up.

Thirteen.

He knew they were thirteen stories up because the windows
were dark. He was bitterly upset. He had bought those shoes
for some absurd price in a store on the Lower East Side in New
York. He had, as a result, written an entire essay on the joys of
great footwear, all of which had been jettisoned in the Mostly
harmless' debacle. Damn everything.

And now one of the shoes was gone. He threw his head
back and stared at the sky.

It wouldn't be such a grim tragedy if the planet in question
hadn't been demolished, which meant that he wouldn't even be
able to get another pair.

Yes, given the infinite sideways extension of probability there
was, of course, an almost infinite multiplicity of planets Earth,
but, when you came down to it, a major pair of shoes wasn't
something you could just replace by mucking about in multi-
dimensional space time.

He sighed.

Oh well, he'd better make the best of it. At least it had
saved his life. For the time being.

He was perched on a foot-wide ledge thirteen stories up the
side of a building and he wasn't at all sure that that was worth
a good shoe.

He stared in woozily through the darkened glass.

It was as dark and silent as the tomb.

No. That was a ridiculous thing to think. He'd been to
some great parties in tombs.

Could he detect some movement? He wasn't quite sure. It
seemed that he could see some kind of weird, flapping shad-
ow. Perhaps it was just blood dribbling over his eyelashes . He
wiped it away. Boy, he'd love to have a farm somewhere, keep
some sheep. He peered into the window again, trying to make
out what the shape was, but he had the feeling, so common in
today's universe, that he was looking into some kind of optical
illusion and that his eyes were just playing silly buggers with him.

Was there a bird of some kind in there? Was that what
they had hidden away up here on a concealed floor behind
darkened, rocket-proof glass? Someone's aviary? There was
certainly something flapping about in there, but it seemed like
not so much a bird, more a kind of bird-shaped hole in space.

He closed his eyes, which he'd been wanting to do for a bit
anyway. He wondered what the hell to do next. Jump? Climb?
He didn't think there was going to be any way of breaking in. OK,
the supposedly rocket-proof glass hadn't stood up, when it came
to it, to an actual rocket, but then that had been a rocket that
had been fired at very short range from inside, which probably
wasn't what the engineers who designed it had had in mind. It
didn't mean he was going to be able to break the window here
by wrapping his fist in his towel and punching. What the hell, he
tried it anyway and hurt his fist. It was just as well he couldn't
get a good swing from where he was sitting or he might have
hurt it quite badly. The building had been sturdily reinforced
when it was completely rebuilt after the Frogstar attack, and
was probably the most heavily armoured publishing company in
the business, but there was always, he thought, some weakness
in any system designed by a corporate committee. He had already
found one of them. The engineers who designed the windows had
not expected them to be hit by a rocket from short range from
the inside, so the window had failed.

So, what would the engineers not be expecting someone
sitting on the ledge outside the window to do?

He wracked his brains for a moment or so before he got it.

The thing they wouldn't be expecting him to do was to be
there in the first place. Only an absolute idiot would be sitting
where he was, so he was winning already. A common mistake
that people make when trying to design something completely
foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.

He pulled his newly acquired credit card from his pocket,
slid it into a crack where the window met its surrounding frame,
and did something a rocket would not have been able to do. He
wiggled it around a bit. He felt a catch slip. He slid the window
open and almost fell backwards off the ledge laughing, giving
thanks as he did so for the Great Ventilation and Telephone
Riots of SrDt .
 The Great Ventilation and Telephone Riots of SrDt had
started off as just a lot of hot air. Hot air was, of course, the
problem that ventilation was supposed to solve and generally it
had solved the problem reasonably well up to the point when
someone invented air-conditioning, which solved the problem
far more throbbingly.

And that was all well and good provided you could stand
the noise and the dribbling until someone else came up with
something even sexier and smarter than air-conditioning which
was called in-building climate control.

Now this was quite something.

The major differences from just ordinary air-conditioning were
that it was thrillingly more expensive, involved a huge amount of
sophisticated measuring and regulating equipment which was far
better at knowing, moment by moment, what kind of air people
wanted to breathe than mere people did.

It also meant that, to be sure that mere people didn't muck
up the sophisticated calculations which the system was making
on their behalf, all the windows in the buildings were built sealed
shut. This is true.

While the systems were being installed, a number of people
who were going to work in the buildings found themselves having
conversations with Breathe-o-Smart systems fitters which went
something like this:

But what if we want to have the windows open?'

You won't want to have the windows open with new Breathe-
o-Smart.'

Yes but supposing we just wanted to have them open for
a little bit?'

You won't want to have them open even for a little bit.
The new Breathe-o-Smart system will see to that.'

Hmmm.'

Enjoy Breathe-o-Smart!'

OK, so what if the Breathe-o-Smart breaks down or goes
wrong or something?'

Ah! One of the smartest features of the Breathe-o-Smart is
that it cannot possibly go wrong. So. No worries on that score.
Enjoy your breathing now, and have a nice day.'

(It was, of course, as a result of the Great Ventilation and
Telephone Riots of SrDt , that all mechanical or electri-
cal or quantum-mechanical or hydraulic or even wind, steam
or piston-driven devices, are now requited to have a certain
legend emblazoned on them somewhere. It doesn't matter how
small the object is, the designers of the object have got to find
a way of squeezing the legend in somewhere, because it is their
attention which is being drawn to it rather than necessarily that
of the user's.

The legend is this:

The major difference between a thing that might go wrong
and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing
that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to
be impossible to get at or repair.')

Major heat waves started to coincide, with almost magical
precision, with major failures of the Breathe-o-Smart systems.
To begin with this merely caused simmering resentment and only
a few deaths from asphyxiation.

The real horror erupted on the day that three events happened
simultaneously. The first event was that Breathe-o-Smart Inc.
issued a statement to the effect that best results were achieved
by using their systems in temperate climates.

The second event was the breakdown of a Breathe-o-Smart
system on a particularly hot and humid day with the resulting
evacuation of many hundreds of office staff into the street where
they met the third event, which was a rampaging mob of long-
distance telephone operators who had got so twisted with having
to say, all day and every day, Thank you for using BSandS' to
every single idiot who picked up a phone that they had finally
taken to the streets with trash cans, megaphones and rifles.

In the ensuing days of carnage every single window in the city,
rocket-proof or not, was smashed, usually to accompanying cries
of Get off the line, asshole! I don't care what number you want,
what extension you're calling from. Go and stick a firework up
your bottom! Yeeehaah! Hoo Hoo Hoo! Velooooom! Squawk!'
and a variety of other animal noises that they didn't get a chance
to practise in the normal line of their work.

As a result of this, all telephone operators were granted a
constitutional right to say Use BSandS and die!' at least once
an hour when answering the phone and all office buildings were
required to have windows that opened, even if only a little bit.

Another, unexpected result was a dramatic lowering of the
suicide rate. All sorts of stressed and rising executives who had
been forced, during the dark days of the Breathe-o-Smart tyr-
anny, to jump in front of trains or stab themselves, could now
just clamber out on to their own window ledges and leap off at
their leisure. What frequently happened, though, was that in the
moment or two they had to look around and gather their thoughts
they would suddenly discover that all they had really needed was
a breath of air and a fresh perspective on things, and maybe also
a farm on which they could keep a few sheep.

Another completely unlooked for result was that Ford Prefect,
stranded thirteen stories up a heavily armoured building armed
with nothing but a towel and a credit card was nevertheless able
to clamber through a supposedly rocket-proof window to safety.

He closed the window neatly after him, having first allowed
Colin to follow him through, and then started to look around
for this bird thing.

The thing he realised about the windows was this: because
they had been converted into openable windows after they had
first been designed to be impregnable, they were, in fact, much
less secure than if they had been designed as openable windows
in the first place.

Hey ho, it's a funny old life, he was just thinking to himself,
when he suddenly realised that the room he had gone to all this
trouble to break into was not a very interesting one.

He stopped in surprise.

Where was the strange flapping shape? Where was anything
that was worth all this palaver - the extraordinary veil of secrecy
that seemed to lie over this room and the equally extraordinary
sequence of events that had seemed to conspire to get him into
it?

The room, like every other room in this building now, was
done out in some appallingly tasteful grey. There were a few
charts and drawings on the wall. Most of them were meaningless
to Ford, but then he came across something that was obviously
a mock-up for a poster of some kind.

There was a kind of bird-like logo on it, and a slogan which said
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy Mk II: the single most
astounding thing of any kind ever. Coming soon to a dimension
near you.' No more information than that.

Ford looked around again. Then his attention was gradually
drawn to Colin, the absurdly over-happy security robot, who was
cowering in a corner of the room gibbering with what seemed
strangely like fear.

Odd, thought Ford. He looked around to see what it was that
Colin might have been reacting to. Then he saw something that
he hadn't noticed before, lying quietly on top of a work bench.

It was circular and black and about the size of a small side
plate. Its top and its bottom were smoothly convex so that it
resembled a small lightweight throwing discus.

Its surfaces seemed to be completely smooth, unbroken and
featureless.

It was doing nothing.
Then Ford noticed that there was something written on it.
Strange. There hadn't been anything written on it a moment
ago and now suddenly there was. There just didn't seem to have
been any observable transition between the two states.

All it said, in small, alarming letters was a single word:
A moment ago there hadn't been any marks or cracks in
its surface. Now there were. They were growing.

Panic, the Guide Mk II said. Ford begin to do as he was
told. He had just remembered why the slug-like creatures looked
familiar. Their colour scheme was a kind of corporate grey, but
in all other respects they looked exactly like Vogons.

The ship dropped quietly to land on the edge of the wide
clearing, a hundred yards or so from the village.

It arrived suddenly and unexpectedly but with a minimum of
fuss. One moment it was a perfectly ordinary late afternoon in
the early autumn - the leaves were just beginning to turn red and
gold, the river was beginning to swell again with the rains from the
mountains in the north, the plumage of the pikka birds was begin-
ning to thicken in anticipation of the coming winter frosts, any day
now the Perfectly Normal Beasts would start their thunderous
migration across the plains, and Old Thrashbarg was beginning
to mutter to himself as he hobbled his way around the village,
a muttering which meant that he was rehearsing and elaborating
the stories that he would tell of the past year once the evenings
had drawn in and people had no choice but to gather round the
fire and listen to him and grumble and say that that wasn't how
they remembered it - and the next moment there was a spaceship
sitting there, gleaming in the warm autumn sun.

It hummed for a bit and then stopped.

It wasn't a big spaceship. If the villagers had been experts
on spaceships they would have known at once that it was a
pretty nifty one, a small sleek Hrundi four-berth runabout
with just about every optional extra in the brochure except
Advanced Vectoid Stabilisis, which only wimps went for. You
can't get a good tight, sharp curve round a tri-lateral time axis
with Advanced Vectoid Stabilisis. All right, it's a bit safer, but
it makes the handling go all soggy.

The villagers didn't know all that, of course. Most of them here
on the remote planet of Lamuella had never seen a spaceship,
certainly not one that was all in one piece, and as it shone warmly
in the evening light it was just the most extraordinary thing they
had come across since the day Kirp caught a fish with a head at
both ends.

Everybody had fallen silent.

Whereas a moment before two or three dozen people had
been wandering about, chattering, chopping wood, carrying
water, teasing the pikka birds, or just amiably trying to stay
out of Old Thrashbarg's way, suddenly all activity died away
and everybody turned to look at the strange object in amazement.

Or, not quite everybody. The pikka birds tended to be amazed
by completely different things. A perfectly ordinary leaf lying
unexpectedly on a stone would cause them to skitter off in par-
oxysms of confusion; sunrise took them completely by surprise
every morning, but the arrival of an alien craft from another
world simply failed to engage any part of their attention. They
continued to kar and rit and huk as they pecked for seeds on the
ground; the river continued with its quiet, spacious burbling.

Also, the noise of loud and tuneless singing from the last
hut on the left continued unabated.

Suddenly, with a slight click and a hum, a door folded itself
outwards and downwards from the spaceship. Then, for a minute
or two, nothing further seemed to happen, other than the loud
singing from the last hut on the left, and the thing just sat there.

Some of the villagers, particularly the boys, began to edge
forward a little bit to have a closer look. Old Thrashbarg tried
to shoo them back. This was exactly the sort of thing that Old
Thrashbarg didn't like to have happening. He hadn't foretold it,
not even slightly, and even though he would be able to wrestle
the whole thing into his continuing story somehow or other, it
really was all getting a bit much to deal with.

He strode forward, pushed the boys back, and raised his arms
and his ancient knobbly staff into the air. The long warm light
of the evening sun caught him nicely. He prepared to welcome
whatever gods these were as if he had been expecting them all
along.

Still nothing happened.

Gradually it became clear that there was some kind of argument
going on inside the craft. Time went by and Old Thrashbarg's
arms were beginning to ache.

Suddenly the ramp folded itself back up again.
That made it easy for Thrashbarg. They were demons and
he had repulsed them. The reason he hadn't foretold it was that
prudence and modesty forbade.

Almost immediately a different ramp folded itself out on the
other side of the craft from where Thrashbarg was standing, and
two figures at last emerged on it, still arguing with each other
and ignoring everybody, even Thrashbarg, whom they wouldn't
even have noticed from where they were standing.

Old Thrashbarg chewed angrily on his beard.

To continue to stand there with his arms upraised? To kneel
with his head bowed forward and his staff held out pointing at
them? To fall backwards as if overcome in some titanic inner
struggle? Perhaps just to go off to the woods and live in a tree
for a year without speaking to anyone?

He opted just to drop his arms smartly as if he had done
what he meant to do. They were really hurting so he didn't
have much choice. He made a small, secret sign he had just
invented towards the ramp which had closed and then made
three and a half steps backwards, so he could at least get a
good look at whoever these people were and then decide what
to do next.

The taller one was a very good looking woman wearing
soft and crumply clothes. Old Thrashbarg didn't know this, but
they were made of Rymplon TM, a new synthetic fabric which was
terrific for space travel because it looked its absolute best when
it was all creased and sweaty.

The shorter one was a girl. She was awkward and sullen
looking, and was wearing clothes which looked their absolute
worst when they were all creased and sweaty, and what was
more she almost certainly knew it.

All eyes watched them, except for the pikka birds, which
had their own things to watch.

The woman stood and looked around her. She had a purposeful
air about her. There was obviously something in particular she
wanted, but she didn't know exactly where to find it. She glanced
from face to face among the villagers assembled curiously around
her without apparently seeing what she was looking for.

Thrashbarg had no idea how to play this at all, and decided
to resort to chanting. He threw back his head and began to
wail, but was instantly interrupted by a fresh outbreak of song
from the hut of the Sandwich Maker: the last one on the left.
The woman looked round sharply, and gradually a smile came
over her face. Without so much as a glance at Old Thrashbarg
she started to walk towards the hut.
 There is an art to the business of making sandwiches which
it is given to few ever to find the time to explore in depth.
It is a simple task, but the opportunities for satisfaction are
many and profound: choosing the right bread for instance. The
Sandwich Maker had spent many months in daily consultation
and experiment with Grarp the baker and eventually they had
between them created a loaf of exactly the consistency that was
dense enough to slice thinly and neatly, while still being light,
moist and having that fine nutty flavour which best enhanced
the savour of roast Perfectly Normal Beast flesh.

There was also the geometry of the slice to be refined: the
precise relationships between the width and height of the slice
and also its thickness which would give the proper sense of bulk
and weight to the finished sandwich: here again, lightness was
a virtue, but so too were firmness, generosity and that promise
of succulence and savour that is the hallmark of a truly intense
sandwich experience.

The proper tools, of course, were crucial, and many were
the days that the Sandwich Maker, when not engaged with the
Baker at his oven, would spend with Strinder the Tool Maker,
weighing and balancing knives, taking them to the forge and
back again. Suppleness, strength, keenness of edge, length and
balance were all enthusiastically debated, theories put forward,
tested, refined, and many was the evening when the Sandwich
Maker and the Tool Maker could be seen silhouetted against
the light of the setting sun and the Tool Maker's forge making
slow sweeping movements through the air trying one knife after
another, comparing the weight of this one with the balance of
another, the suppleness of a third and the handle binding of a
fourth.

Three knives altogether were required. First there was the
knife for the slicing of the bread: a firm, authoritative blade
which imposed a clear and defining will on a loaf. Then there
was the butter-spreading knife, which was a whippy little number
but still with a firm backbone to it. Early versions had been a little
too whippy, but now the combination of flexibility with a core of
strength was exactly right to achieve the maximum smoothness
and grace of spread.

The chief amongst the knives, of course, was the carving
knife. This was the knife that would not merely impose its will
on the medium through which it moved, as did the bread knife;
it must work with it, be guided by the grain of the meat, to
achieve slices of the most exquisite consistency and translucency,
that would slide away in filmy folds from the main hunk of meat.
The Sandwich Maker would then flip each sheet with a smooth
flick of the wrist on to the beautifully proportioned lower bread
slice, trim it with four deft strokes and then at last perform the
magic that the children of the village so longed to gather round
and watch with rapt attention and wonder. With just four more
dexterous flips of the knife he would assemble the trimmings
into a perfectly fitting jigsaw of pieces on top of the primary
slice. For every sandwich the size and shape of the trimmings
were different, but the Sandwich Maker would always effortlessly
and without hesitation assemble them into a pattern which fitted
perfectly. A second layer of meat and a second layer of trimmings,
and the main act of creation would be accomplished.

The Sandwich Maker would pass what he had made to his
assistant who would then add a few slices of newcumber and
fladish and a touch of splagberry sauce, and then apply the
topmost layer of bread and cut the sandwich with a fourth
and altogether plainer knife. It was not that these were not also
skilful operations, but they were lesser skills to be performed by
a dedicated apprentice who would one day, when the Sandwich
Maker finally laid down his tools, take over from him. It was
an exalted position and that apprentice, Drimple, was the envy
of his fellows. There were those in the village who were happy
chopping wood, those who were content carrying water, but to
be the Sandwich Maker was very heaven.

And so the Sandwich Maker sang as he worked.

He was using the last of the year's salted meat. It was a little
past its best now, but still the rich savour of Perfectly Normal
Beast meat was something unsurpassed in any of the Sandwich
Maker's previous experience. Next week it was anticipated that
the Perfectly Normal Beasts would appear again for their regu-
lar migration, whereupon the whole village would once again be
plunged into frenetic action: hunting the Beasts, killing perhaps
six, maybe even seven dozen of the thousands that thundered
past. Then the Beasts must be rapidly butchered and cleaned,
with most of the meat salted to keep it through the winter months
until the return migration in the spring, which would replenish
their supplies.

The very best of the meat would be roasted straight away
for the feast that marked the Autumn Passage. The celebrations
would last for three days of sheer exuberance, dancing and stories
that Old Thrashbarg would tell of how the hunt had gone, stories
that he would have been busy sitting making up in his hut while
the rest of the village was out doing the actual hunting.

And then the very, very best of the meat would be saved
from the feast and delivered cold to the Sandwich Maker. And
the Sandwich Maker would exercise on it the skills that he
had brought to them from the gods, and make the exquisite
Sandwiches of the Third Season, of which the whole village would
partake before beginning, the next day, to prepare themselves for
the rigours of the coming winter.

Today he was just making ordinary sandwiches, if such deli-
cacies, so lovingly crafted, could ever be called ordinary. Today
his assistant was away so the Sandwich Maker was applying his
own garnish, which he was happy to do. He was happy with just
about everything in fact.

He sliced, he sang. He flipped each slice of meat neatly on to
a slice of bread, trimmed it and assembled all the trimmings into
their jigsaw. A little salad, a little sauce, another slice of bread,
another sandwich, another verse of Yellow Submarine.

Hello , Arthur.'

The Sandwich Maker almost sliced his thumb off.
 The villagers had watched in consternation as the woman had
marched boldly to the hut of the Sandwich Maker. The Sandwich
Maker had been sent to them by Almighty Bob in a burning fiery
chariot. This, at least, was what Thrashbarg said, and Thrashbarg
was the authority on these things. So, at least, Thrashbarg
claimed, and Thrashbarg was... and so on and so on. It
was hardly worth arguing about.

A few villagers wondered why Almighty Bob would send
his onlie begotten Sandwich Maker in a burning fiery chariot
rather than perhaps in one that might have landed quietly
without destroying half the forest, filling it with ghosts and also
injuring the Sandwich Maker quite badly. Old Thrashbarg said
that it was the ineffable will of Bob, and when they asked him
what ineffable meant he said look it up.

This was a problem because Old Thrashbarg had the only
dictionary and he wouldn't let them borrow it. They asked him
why not and he said that it was not for them to know the will
of Almighty Bob, and when they asked him why not again he
said because he said so. Anyway, somebody sneaked into Old
Thrashbarg's hut one day while he was out having a swim and
looked up ineffable'. Ineffable' apparently meant unknowable,
indescribable, unutterable, not to be known or spoken about'. So
that cleared that up.

At least they had got the sandwiches.

One day Old Thrashbarg said that Almighty Bob had decreed
that he, Thrashbarg, was to have first pick of the sandwiches.
The villagers asked him when this had happened, exactly, and
Thrashbarg said it had happened yesterday, when they weren't
looking. Have faith,' Old Thrashbarg said, or burn!'
They let him have first pick of the sandwiches. It seemed
easiest.
 And now this woman had just arrived out of nowhere, and gone
straight for the Sandwich Maker's hut. His fame had obviously
spread, though it was hard to know where to since, according to
Old Thrashbarg, there wasn't anywhere else. Anyway, wherever
it was she had come from, presumably somewhere ineffable, she
was here now and was in the Sandwich Maker's hut. Who was
she? And who was the strange girl who was hanging around
outside the hut moodily and kicking at stones and showing every
sign of not wanting to be there? It seemed odd that someone
should come all the way from somewhere ineffable in a chariot
that was obviously a vast improvement on the burning fiery one
which had brought them the Sandwich Maker, if she didn't even
want to be here?

They all looked to Thrashbarg, but he was on his knees
mumbling and looking very firmly up into the sky and not
catching anybody else's eye until he'd thought of something.
 Trillian!' said the Sandwich Maker, sucking his bleeding thumb.
What...? Who...? When...? Where...?'

Exactly the questions I was going to ask you,' said Trillian,
looking around Arthur's hut. It was neatly laid out with his
kitchen utensils. There were some fairly basic cupboards and
shelves, and a basic bed in the corner. A door at the back of
the room led to something Trillian couldn't see because the door
was closed. Nice,' she said, but in an enquiring tone of voice. She
couldn't quite make out what the set-up was.

Very nice,' said Arthur. Wonderfully nice. I don't know
when I've ever been anywhere nicer. I'm happy here. They
like me, I make sandwiches for them, and... er, well that's
it really. They like me and I make sandwiches for them.'

Sounds, er...'

Idyllic,' said Arthur, firmly. It is. It really is. I don't expect
you'd like it very much, but for me it's, well, it's perfect. Look, sit
down, please, make yourself comfortable. Can I get you anything,
er, a sandwich?'

Trillian picked up a sandwich and looked at it. She sniffed
it carefully.

Try it,' said Arthur, it's good.'

Trillian took a nibble, then a bite and munched on it thought-
fully.

It is good,' she said, looking at it.

My life's work,' said Arthur, trying to sound proud and
hoping he didn't sound like a complete idiot. He was used
to being revered a bit, and was having to go through some
unexpected mental gear changes.

What's the meat in it?' asked Trillian.

Ah yes, that's, um, that's Perfectly Normal Beast.'

It's what?'

Perfectly Normal Beast. It's a bit like a cow, or rather
a bull. Kind of like a buffalo in fact. Large, charging sort
of animal.'

So what's odd about it?'

Nothing, it's Perfectly Normal.'

I see.'

It's just a bit odd where it comes from.'

Tricia frowned, and stopped chewing.

Where does it come from?' she asked with her mouth full.
She wasn't going to swallow until she knew.

Well it's not just a matter of where it comes from, it's also
where it goes to. It's all right, it's perfectly safe to swallow. I've
eaten tons of it. It's great. Very succulent. Very tender. Slightly
sweet flavour with a long dark finish.'

Trillian still hadn't swallowed.

Where,' she said, does it come from, and where does it go to?'

They come from a point just slightly to the east of the
Hondo Mountains. They're the big ones behind us here, you
must have seen them as you came in, and then they sweep in
their thousands across the great Anhondo plains and, er, well
that's it really. That's where they come from. That's where they
go.'

Trillian frowned. There was something she wasn't quite getting
about this.

I probably haven't made it quite clear,' said Arthur. When
I say they come from a point to the east of the Hondo Moun-
tains, I mean that that's where they suddenly appear. Then they
sweep across the Anhondo plains and, well, vanish really. We
have about six days to catch as many of them as we can before
they disappear. In the spring they do it again only the other way
round, you see.'

Reluctantly, Trillian swallowed. It was either that or spit
it out, and it did in fact taste pretty good.

I see,' she said, once she had reassured herself that she
didn't seem to be suffering any ill effects. And why are they
called Perfectly Normal Beasts?'

Well, I think because otherwise people might think it was
a bit odd. I think Old Thrashbarg called them that. He says
that they come from where they come from and they go to
where they go to and that it's Bob's will and that's all there is
to it.'

Who...'

Just don't even ask.'

Well, you look well on it.'

I feel well. You look well.'

I'm well. I'm very well.'

Well, that's good.'

Yes.'

Good.'

Good.'

Nice of you to drop in.'

Thanks.'

Well,' said Arthur, casting around himself. Astounding how
hard it was to think of anything to say to someone after all this
time.

I expect you're wondering how I found you,' said Trillian.

Yes!' said Arthur. I was wondering exactly that. How did
you find me?'

Well, as you may or may not know, I now work for one
of the big Sub-Etha broadcasting networks that -'

I did know that,' said Arthur, suddenly remembering. Yes,
you've done very well. That's terrific. Very exciting. Well done.
Must be a lot of fun.'

Exhausting.'

All that rushing around. I expect it must be, yes.'

We have access to virtually every kind of information. I
found your name on the passenger list of the ship that crashed.'

Arthur was astonished.

You mean they knew about the crash?'

Well, of course they knew. You don't have a whole spaceliner
disappear without someone knowing about it.'

But you mean, they knew where it had happened? They
knew I'd survived?'

Yes.'

But nobody's ever been to look or search or rescue. There's
been absolutely nothing.'

Well there wouldn't be. It's a whole complicated insurance
thing. They just bury the whole thing. Pretend it never happened.
The insurance business is completely screwy now. You know
they've reintroduced the death penalty for insurance company
directors?'

Really?' said Arthur. No I didn't. For what offence?'

Trillian frowned.

What do you mean, offence?'

I see.'

Trillian gave Arthur a long look, and then, in a new tone
of voice, said, It's time for you to take responsibility, Arthur.'

Arthur tried to understand this remark. He found it often
took a moment or so before he saw exactly what it was that
people were driving at, so he let a moment or two pass at a
leisurely rate. Life was so pleasant and relaxed these days, there
was time to let things sink in. He let it sink in.

He still didn't quite understand what she meant, though,
so in the end he had to say so.

Trillian gave him a cool smile and then turned back to
the door of the hut.

Random?' she called. Come in. Come and meet your father.'

As the Guide folded itself back into a smooth, dark disk, Ford
realised some pretty hectic stuff. Or at least he tried to realise
it, but it was too hectic to take in all in one go. His head was
hammering, his ankle was hurting, and though he didn't like to
be a wimp about his ankle, he always found that intense multi-
dimensional logic was something he understood best in the bath.
He needed time to think about this. Time, a tall drink, and some
kind of rich, foamy oil.

He had to get out of here. He had to get the Guide out
of here. He didn't think they'd make it together.

He glanced wildly round the room.

Think, think, think. It had to be something simple and obvious.
If he was right in his nasty lurking suspicion that he was dealing
with nasty, lurking Vogons, then the more simple and obvious
the better.

Suddenly he saw what he needed.

He wouldn't try to beat the system, he would just use it. The
frightening thing about the Vogons was their absolute mindless
determination to do whatever mindless thing it was they were
determined to do. There was never any point in trying to appeal
to their reason because they didn't have any. However, if you
kept your nerve you could sometimes exploit their blinkered,
bludgeoning insistence on being bludgeoning and blinkered. It
wasn't merely that their left hand didn't always know what their
right hand was doing, so to speak; quite often their right hand
had a pretty hazy notion as well.

Did he dare just post the thing to himself?

Did he dare just put it in the system and let the Vogons
work out how to get the thing to him while at the same time
they were busy, as they probably would be, tearing the building
apart to find out where he'd hidden it?

Yes.

Feverishly, he packed it. He wrapped it. He labelled it.
With a moment's pause to wonder if he was really doing the
right thing, he committed the package to the building's internal
mail chute.

Colin,' he said, turning to the little, hovering ball. I am
going to abandon you to your fate.'

I'm so happy,' said Colin.

Make the most of it,' said Ford. Because what I want you
to do is to nursemaid that package out of the building. They'll
probably incinerate you when they find you, and I won't be here
to help. It will be very, very nasty for you, and that's just too
bad. Got it?'

I gurgle with pleasure,' said Colin.

Go!' said Ford.

Colin obediently dived down the mail chute in pursuit of his
charge. Now Ford had only himself to worry about, but that was
still quite a substantial worry. There were noises of heavy running
footsteps outside the door, which he had taken the precaution of
locking and shifting a large filing cabinet in front of.

He was worried that everything had gone so smoothly. Every-
thing had fitted terribly well. He had hurtled through the day
with reckless abandon and yet everything had worked out with
uncanny neatness. Except for his shoe. He was bitter about his
shoe. That was an account that was going to have to be settled.

With a deafening roar the door exploded inwards. In the
turmoil of smoke and dust he could see large, slug-like creatures
hurrying through.

So everything was going well was it? Everything was working
out as if the most extraordinary luck was on his side? Well, he'd
see about that.

In a spirit of scientific enquiry he hurled himself out of
the window again.

The first month, getting to know each other, was a little difficult.

The second month, trying to come to terms with what they'd
got to know about each other in the first month, was much easier.

The third month, when the box arrived, was very tricky indeed.

At the beginning, it was a problem even trying to explain
what a month was. This had been a pleasantly simple matter
for Arthur, here on Lamuella. The days were just a little over
twenty-five hours long, which basically meant an extra hour in
bed every single day and, of course, having regularly to reset his
watch, which Arthur rather enjoyed doing.

He also felt at home with the number of suns and moons
which Lamuella had - one of each - as opposed to some of
the planets he'd fetched up on from time to time which had
had ridiculous numbers of them.

The planet orbited its single sun every three hundred days,
which was a good number because it meant the year didn't drag
by. The moon orbited Lamuella just over nine times a year,
which meant that a month was a little over thirty days, which
was absolutely perfect because it gave you a little more time to
get things done in. It was not merely reassuringly like Earth, it
was actually rather an improvement.

Random, on the other hand, thought she was trapped in a
recurring nightmare. She would have crying fits and think the
moon was out to get her. Every night it was there, and then,
when it went, the sun came out and followed her. Over and over
again.

Trillian had warned Arthur that Random might have some
difficulty in adjusting to a more regular lifestyle than she had
been used to up till now, but Arthur hadn't been ready for
actual howling at the moon.

He hadn't been ready for any of this of course.

His daughter?

His daughter? He and Trillian had never even - had they?
He was absolutely convinced he would have remembered. What
about Zaphod?

Not the same species, Arthur,' Trillian had answered. When
I decided I wanted a child they ran all sorts of genetic tests on
me and could find only one match anywhere. It was only later
that it dawned on me. I double checked and I was right. They
don't usually like to tell you, but I insisted.'

You mean you went to a DNA bank?' Arthur had asked,
pop-eyed.

Yes. But she wasn't quite as random as her name suggests,
because, of course, you were the only homo sapiens donor. I
must say, though, it seems you were quite a frequent flyer.'

Arthur had stared wide-eyed at the unhappy looking girl who
was slouching awkwardly in the door-frame looking at him.

But when... how long...?'

You mean, what age is she?'

Yes.'

The wrong one.'

What do you mean?'

I mean that I haven't any idea.'

What?'

Well, in my time line I think it's about ten years since I had
her, but she's obviously quite a lot older than that. I spend my
life going backwards and forwards in time, you see. The job. I
used to take her with me when I could, but it just wasn't always
possible. Then I used to put her into day care time zones, but
you just can't get reliable time tracking now. You leave them
there in the morning, you've simply no idea how old they'll be
in the evening. You complain till you're blue in the face but it
doesn't get you anywhere. I left her at one of the places for a
few hours once, and when I came back she'd passed puberty.
I've done all I can, Arthur, it's over to you. I've got a war to
cover.'
The ten seconds that passed after Trillian left were about the
longest of Arthur Dent's life. Time, we know, is relative. You
can travel light years through the stars and back, and if you do it
at the speed of light then, when you return, you may have aged
mere seconds while your twin brother or sister will have aged
twenty, thirty, forty or however many years it is, depending on
how far you travelled.

This will come to you as a profound personal shock, particularly
if you didn't know you had a twin brother or sister. The seconds
that you have been absent for will not have been sufficient time to
prepare you for the shock of new and strangely distended family
relationships when you return.

Ten seconds' silence was not enough time for Arthur to
reassemble his whole view of himself and his life in a way that
suddenly included an entire new daughter of whose merest exist-
ence he had had not the slightest inkling of a suspicion when he
had woken that morning. Deep, emotional family ties cannot be
constructed in ten seconds, however far and fast you travel away
from them, and Arthur could only feel helpless, bewildered and
numb as he looked at the girl standing in his doorway, staring at
his floor.

He supposed that there was no point in pretending not to
be hopeless.

He walked over and he hugged her.

I don't love you,' he said. I'm sorry. I don't even know
you yet. But give me a few minutes.'
 We live in strange times.
 We also live in strange places: each in a universe of our
 own. The people with whom we populate our universes are
 the shadows of whole other universes intersecting with our
 own. Being able to glance out into this bewildering complexity
 of infinite recursion and say things like, Oh, hi Ed! Nice tan.
 How's Carol?' involves a great deal of filtering skill for which
 all conscious entities have eventually to develop a capacity in
 order to protect themselves from the contemplation of the
 chaos through which they seethe and tumble. So give your
 kid a break, OK?
What's this?'

Arthur had almost given up. That is to say, he was not
going to give up. He was absolutely not going to give up.
Not now. Not ever. But if he had been the sort of person who
was going to give up, this was probably the time he would have
done it.

Not content with being surly, bad-tempered, wanting to go
and play in the paleozoic era, not seeing why they had to have
the gravity on the whole time and shouting at the sun to stop
following her, Random had also used his carving knife to dig up
stones to throw at the pikka birds for looking at her like that.

Arthur didn't even know if Lamuella had had a paleozoic
era. According to Old Thrashbarg the planet had been found
fully-formed in the navel of a giant earwig at four-thirty one
Vroonday afternoon, and although Arthur, as a seasoned galactic
traveller with good O' level passes in Physics and Geography,
had fairly serious doubts about this, it was rather a waste of time
trying to argue with Old Thrashbarg and there had never been
much point before.

He sighed as he sat nursing the chipped and bent knife. He
was going to love her if it killed him, or her, or both. It wasn't
easy being a father. He knew that no one had ever said it was
going to be easy, but that wasn't the point because he'd never
asked about being one in the first place.

He was doing his best. Every moment that he could wrest
away from making sandwiches he was spending with her, talking
to her, walking with her, sitting on the hill with her watching the
sun go down over he valley in which the village nestled, trying
to find out about her life, trying to explain to her about his. It
was a tricky business. The common ground between them, apart
from the fact that they had almost identical genes, was about the
size of a pebble. Or rather, it was about the size of Trillian and
of her they had slightly differing views.

What's this?'

He suddenly realised she had been talking to him and he
hadn't noticed. Or rather he had not recognized her voice.

Instead of the usual tone of voice in which she spoke to him,
which was bitter and truculent, she was just asking him a simple
question.

He looked round in surprise.

She was sitting there on a stool in the corner of the hut in
that rather hunched way she had, knees together, feet splayed
out, with her dark hair hanging down over her face as she looked
at something she had cradled in her hands.

Arthur went over to her, a little nervously.

Her mood swings were very unpredictable but so far they'd
all been between different types of bad ones. Outbreaks of bitter
recrimination would give way without warning to abject self-pity
and then long bouts of sullen despair which were punctuated with
sudden acts of mindless violence against inanimate objects and
demands to go to electric clubs.

Not only were there no electric clubs on Lamuella, there
were no clubs at all and, in fact, no electricity. There was a
forge and a bakery, a few carts and a well, but those were the
high water mark of Lamuellan technology, and a fair number of
Random's unquenchable rages were directed against the sheer
incomprehensible backwardness of the place.

She could pick up Sub-Etha TV on a small Flex-O-Panel
which had been surgically implanted in her wrist, but that didn't
cheer her up at all because it was full of news of insanely exciting
things happening in every other part of the Galaxy than here.
It would also give her frequent news of her mother, who had
dumped her to go off and cover some war which now seemed
not to have happened, or at least to have gone all wrong in some
way because of the absence of any proper intelligence gathering.
It also gave her access to lots of great adventure shows featuring
all sorts of fantastically expensive spaceships crashing into each
other.

The villagers were absolutely hypnotised by all these wonderful
magic images flashing over her wrist. They had only ever seen
one spaceship crash, and it had been so frightening, violent and
shocking and had caused so much horrible devastation, fire and
death that, stupidly, they had never realised it was entertainment.

Old Thrashbarg had been so astonished by it that he had
instantly seen Random as an emissary from Bob, but had fairly
soon afterwards decided that in fact she had been sent as a test
of his faith, if not of his patience. He was also alarmed at the
number of spaceship crashes he had to start incorporating into
his holy stories if he was to hold the attention of the villagers,
and not have them rushing off to peer at Random's wrist all the
time.

At the moment she was not peering at her wrist. Her wrist
was turned off. Arthur squatted down quietly beside her to see
what she was looking at.

It was his watch. He had taken it off when he'd gone to
shower under the local waterfall, and Random had found it
and was trying to work it out.

It's just a watch,' he said. It's to tell the time.'

I know that,' she said. But you keep on fiddling with it,
and it still doesn't tell the right time. Or even anything like
it.'

She brought up the display on her wrist panel, which auto-
matically produced a readout of local time. Her wrist panel had
quietly got on with the business of measuring the local gravity
and orbital momentum, and had noticed where the sun was and
tracked its movement in the sky, all within the first few minutes
of Random's arrival. It had then quickly picked up clues from its
environment as to what the local unit conventions were and reset
itself appropriately. It did this sort of thing continually, which was
particularly valuable if you did a lot of travelling in time as well
as space.

Random frowned at her father's watch, which didn't do any
of this.

Arthur was very fond of it. It was a better one than he
would ever have afforded himself. He had been given it on
his twenty-second birthday by a rich and guilt-ridden godfather
who had forgotten every single birthday he had had up till then,
and also his name. It had the day, the date, the phases of the
moon; it had To Albert on his twenty-first birthday' and the
wrong date engraved on the battered and scratched surface of
its back in letters that were still just about visible.

The watch had been through a considerahle amount of stuff
in the last few years, most of which would fall well outside the
warranty. He didn't suppose, of course, that the warranty had
especially mentioned that the watch was guaranteed to be accu-
rate only within the very particular gravitational and magnetic
fields of the Earth, and so long as the day was twenty-four hours
long and the planet didn't explode and so on. These were such
basic assumptions that even the lawyers would have missed them.

Luckily his watch was a wind-up one, or at least, a self-winder.
Nowhere else in the Galaxy would he have found batteries of pre-
cisely the dimensions and power specifications that were perfectly
standard on Earth.

So what are all these numbers?' asked Random.

Arthur took it from her.

These numbers round the edge mark the hours. In the little
window on the right it says THU, which means Thursday, and
the number is , which means it's the fourteenth day of the
month of MAY which is what it says in this window over here.

And this sort of crescent-shaped window at the top tells you
about the phases of the moon. In other words it tells you how
much of the moon is lit up at night by the sun, which depends
on the relative positions of the Sun and the Moon and, well...
the Earth.'

The Earth,' said Random.

Yes.'

And that's where you came from, and where Mum came from.'

Yes.'

Random took the watch back from him and looked at it
again, clearly baffled by something. Then she held it up to
her ear and listened in puzzlement.

What's that noise?'

It's ticking. That's the mechanism that drives the watch. It's
called clockwork. It's all kind of interlocking cogs and springs
that work to turn the hands round at exactly the right speed to
mark the hours and minutes and days and so on.'

Random carried on peering at it.

There's something puzzling you,' said Arthur. What is it?'

Yes,' said Random, at last. Why's it all in hardware?'
Arthur suggested they went for a walk. He felt there were
things they should discuss, and for once Random seemed, if
not precisely amenable and willing, then at least not growling.

From Random's point of view this was also all very weird. It
wasn't that she wanted to be difficult, as such, it was just that
she didn't know how or what else to be.

Who was this guy? What was this life she was supposed to
lead? What was this world she was supposed to lead it in? And
what was this universe that kept coming at her through her eyes
and ears? What was it for? What did it want?

She'd been born in a spaceship that had been going from
somewhere to somewhere else, and when it had got to some-
where else, somewhere else had only turned out to be another
somewhere that you had to get to somewhere else again from,
and so on.

It was her normal expectation that she was supposed to be
somewhere else. It was normal for her to feel that she was in
the wrong place.

Then, constant time travel had only compounded this problem,
and had led to the feeling that she was not only always in the
wrong place, but she was also almost always there at the wrong
time.

She didn't notice that she felt this, because it was the only
way she ever felt, just as it never seemed odd to her that
nearly everywhere she went she needed either to wear weights
or anti-gravity suits and usually special apparatus for breathing
as well. The only places you could ever feel right were worlds you
designed for yourself to inhabit - virtual realities in the electric
clubs. It had never occurred to her that the real Universe was
something you could actually fit into.

And that included this Lamuella place her mother had dumped
her in. And it also included this person who had bestowed on her
this precious and magical gift of life in return for a seat upgrade.
It was just as well he had turned out to be rather kind and friendly
or there would have been trouble. Really. She'd got a specially
sharpened stone in her pocket she could cause a lot of trouble
with.

It can be very dangerous to see things from somebody else's
point of view without the proper training.
They sat on the spot that Arthur particularly liked, on the side
of a hill overlooking the valley. The sun was going down over
the village.

The only thing that Arthur wasn't quite so fond of was being
able to see a little way into the next valley, where a deep dark
mangled furrow in the forest marked the spot where his ship
had crashed. But maybe that was what kept bringing him back
here. There were plenty of spots from which you could survey
the lush rolling countryside of Lamuella, but this was the one
he was drawn to, with its nagging dark spot of fear and pain
nestling just on the edge of his vision.

He had never been there again since he had been pulled
out of the wreckage.

Wouldn't.

Couldn't bear it.

In fact he had gone some of the way back to it the very next
day, while he was still numb and spinning with shock. He had
a broken leg, a couple of broken ribs, some bad burns and was
not really thinking coherently but had insisted that the villagers
take him, which, uneasily, they had. He had not managed to
get right to the actual spot where the ground had bubbled and
melted, however, and had at last hobbled away from the horror
for ever.

Soon, word had got around that the whole area was haunted
and no one had ventured back there ever since. The land was full
of beautiful, verdant and delightful valleys - no point in going to
a highly worrying one. Let the past hold on to itself and let the
present move forward into the future.
Random cradled the watch in her hands, slowly turning it
to let the long light of the evening sun shine warmly in the
scratches and scuffs of the thick glass. It fascinated her watching
the spidery little second hand ticking its way round. Every time
it completed a full circle, the longer of the two main hands had
moved on exactly to the next of the sixty small divisions round
the dial. And when the long hand had made its own full circle.
the smaller hand had moved on to the next of the main digits.

You've been watching it for over an hour.' said Arthur,
quietly.

I know, she said. An hour is when the big hand has gone
all the way round, yes?'

That's right.'

Then I've been watching it for an hour and seventeen...
minutes.'

She smiled with a deep and mysterious pleasure and moved
very slightly so that she was resting just a little. against his arm.
Arthur felt a small sigh escape from him that had been pent up
inside his chest for weeks. He wanted to put his arm around his
daughter's shoulders, but felt it was too early yet and that she
would shy away from him. But something was working. Some-
thing was easing inside her. The watch meant something to her
that nothing in her life had so far managed to do. Arthur was
not sure that he had really understood what it was yet, but he
was profoundly pleased and relieved that something had reached
her.

Explain to me again,' said Random.

There's nothing really to it,' said Arthur. Clockwork was
something that developed over hundreds of years...'

Earth years.'

Yes. It became finer and finer and more and more intricate.
It was highly skilled and delicate work. It had to be made very
small, and it had to carry on working accurately however much
you waved it around or dropped it.'

But only on one planet?'

Well, that was where it was made, you see. It was never
expected to go anywhere else and deal with different suns and
moons and magnetic fields and things. I mean the thing still
goes perfectly well, but it doesn't really mean much this far
from Switzerland.'

From where?'

Switzerland. That's where these were made. Small hilly coun-
try. Tiresomely neat. The people who made them didn't really
know there were other worlds.'

Quite a big thing not to know.'

Well, yes.'

So where did they come from?'

They, that is we... we just sort of grew there. We evolv-
ed on the Earth. From, I don't know, some kind of sludge or
something.'

Like this watch.'

Um. I don't think the watch grew out of sludge.'

You don't understand!'

Random suddenly leaped to her feet, shouting.

You don't understand! You don't understand me, you don't
understand anything! I hate you for being so stupid!'

She started to run hectically down the hill, still clutching
the watch and shouting that she hated him.

Arthur jumped up, startled and at a loss. He started to run
after her through the stringy and clumpy grass. It was hard and
painful for him. When he had broken his leg in the crash, it had
not been a clean break, and it had not healed cleanly. He was
stumbling and wincing as he ran.

Suddenly she turned and faced him, her face dark with anger.

She brandished the watch at him. You don't understand
that there's somewhere this belongs? Somewhere it works?
Somewhere that it fits?'

She turned and ran again. She was fit and fleet-footed and
Arthur could not remotely keep up with her.

It wasn't that he had not expected being a father to be
this difficult, it was that he hadn't expected to be a father
at all, particularly not suddenly and unexpectedly on an alien
planet.

Random turned to shout at him again. For some reason
he stopped each time she did.

Who do you think I am?' she demanded angrily. Your
upgrade? Who do you think Mum thought I was? Some sort
of ticket to the life she didn't have?'

I don't know what you mean by that,' said Arthur, panting
and hurting.

You don't know what anybody means by anything!'

What do you mean?'

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!'

Tell me! Please tell me! What does she mean by saying
the life she didn't have?'

She wished she'd stayed on Earth! She wished she hadn't
gone off with that stupid brain-dead fruit gum, Zaphod! She
thinks she would have had a different life!'

But,' said Arthur, she would have been killed! She would
have been killed when the world was destroyed!'

That's a different life isn't it?'

That's...'

She wouldn't have had to have me! She hates me!'

You can't mean that! How could anyone possibly, er, I
mean...'

She had me because I was meant to make things fit for her.
That was my job. But I fitted even worse than she did! So she
just shut me off and carried on with her stupid life.'

What's stupid about her life? She's fantastically successful,
isn't she? She's all over time and space, all over the Sub-Etha
TV networks...'

Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!'

Random turned and ran off again. Arthur couldn't keep up
with her and at last he had to sit down for a bit and let the pain
in his leg subside. The turmoil in his head he didn't know what
to do with at all.
He hobbled into the village an hour later. It was getting dark. The
villagers he passed said hello, but there was a sense of nervousness
and of not quite knowing what was going on or what to do about
it in the air. Old Thrashbarg had been seen pulling on his beard
a fair bit and looking at the moon, and that was not a good sign
either.

Arthur went into his hut.

Random was sitting hunched quietly over the table.

I'm sorry,' she said. I'm so sorry.'

That's all right,' said Arthur as gently as he knew how. It's
good to, well, to have a little chat. There's so much we have to
learn and understand about each other, and life isn't, well it isn't
all just tea and sandwiches...'

I'm so sorry,' she said again, sobbing.

Arthur went up to her and put his arm round her shoulder.
She didn't resist or pull away. Then Arthur saw what it was she
was so sorry about.

In the pool of light thrown by a Lamuellan lantern lay
Arthur's watch. Random had forced the back off it with the
back edge of the butter spreading knife, and all of the minute
cogs and springs and levers were lying in a tiny cock-eyed mess
where she'd been fiddling with them.

I just wanted to see how it worked,' said Random, how it
all fitted together. I'm so sorry! I can't get it back together. I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I don't know what to do. I'll get it
repaired! Really! I'll get it repaired!'
The following day Thrashbarg came round and said all sorts
of Bob stuff. He tried to exert a calming influence by inviting
Random to let her mind dwell on the ineffable mystery of the
giant earwig, and Random said there was no giant earwig and
Thrashbarg went very cold and silent and said she would be cast
into outer darkness. Random said good, she'd been born there,
and the next day the parcel arrived.
This was all getting a bit eventful.

In fact, when the parcel arrived, delivered by a kind of robot
drone that dropped out of the sky making droning robot noises,
it brought with it a sense which gradually began to permeate
through the whole village, that it was almost one event too many.

It wasn't the robot drone's fault. All it required was Arthur
Dent's signature or thumb print, or just a few scrapings of skin
cells from the nape of his neck and it would be on its way again.
It hung around waiting, not quite sure what all this resentment
was about. Meanwhile, Kirp had caught another fish with a head
at both ends, but on closer inspection it turned out that it was in
fact two fish cut in half and sewn together rather badly, so not
only had Kirp failed to rekindle any great interest in two-headed
fish but he had seriously cast doubt on the authenticity of the
first one. Only the pikka birds seemed to feel that everything
was exactly normal.

The robot drone got Arthur's signature and made its escape.
Arthur bore the parcel back to his hut and sat and looked at
it.

Let's open it!' said Random, who was feeling much more
cheerful this morning now that everything around her had got
thoroughly weird, but Arthur said no.

Why not?'

It's not addressed to me.'

Yes, it is.'

No, it isn't. It's addressed to... well, it's addressed to
Ford Prefect, in care of me.'

Ford Prefect? Is he the one who...'

Yes,' said Arthur tartly.

I've heard about him.'

I expect you have.'

Let' s open it anyway. What else are we going to do?'

I don't know,' said Arthur, who really wasn't sure.
He had taken his damaged knives over to the forge bright
and early that morning and Strinder had had a look at them
and said that he would see what he could do.

They had tried the usual business of waving the knives through
the air, feeling for the point of balance and the point of flex and
so on, but the joy was gone from it, and Arthur had a sad feeling
that his sandwich making days were probably numbered.

He hung his head.

The next appearance of the Perfectly Normal Beasts was
imminent, but Arthur felt that the usual festivities of hunting
and feasting were going to be rather muted and uncertain.
Something had happened here on Lamuella, and Arthur had
a horrible feeling that it was him.

What do you think it is?' urged Random, turning the parcel
over in her hands.

I don't know, said Arthur. Something bad and worrying,
though.'

How do you know?' Random protested.

Because anything to do with Ford Prefect is bound to be
worse and more worrying than something that isn't,' said Arthur.
Believe me.'

You're upset about something, aren't you?' said Random.

Arthur sighed.

I'm just feeling a little jumpy and unsettled, I think,' said
Arthur.

I'm sorry,' said Random, and put the package down again.
She could see that it really would upset him if she opened it.
She would just have to do it when he wasn't looking.

Arthur wasn't quite certain which he noticed as being missing
first. When he noticed that the one wasn't there his mind instantly
leapt to the other and he knew immediately that they were both
gone and that something insanely bad and difficult to deal with
would happen as a result.

Random was not there. And neither was the parcel.

He had left it up on a shelf all day, in plain view. It was
an exercise in trust.

He knew that one of the things he was supposed to do as a
parent was to show trust in his child, to build a sense of trust
and confidence into the bedrock of relationship between them.
He had had a nasty feeling that that might be an idiotic thing to
do, but he did it anyway, and sure enough it had turned out to
be an idiotic thing to do. You live and learn. At any rate, you
live.

You also panic.

Arthur ran out of the hut. It was the middle of the evening.
The light was getting dim and a storm was brewing. He could
not see her anywhere, nor any sign of her. He asked. No one
had seen her. He asked again. No one else had seen her. They
were going home for the night . A little wind was whipping round
the edge of the village, picking things up and tossing them around
in a dangerously casual manner.

He found Old Thrashbarg and asked him. Thrashbarg looked
at him stonily, and then pointed in the one direction that Arthur
had dreaded, and had therefore instinctively known was the way
she would have gone.

So now he knew the worst.

She had gone where she thought he would not follow her.

He looked up at the sky, which was sullen, streaked and livid,
and reflected that it was the sort of sky that the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse wouldn't feel like a bunch of complete idiots
riding out of.

With a heavy sense of the utmost foreboding he set off
on the track that led to the forest in the next valley. The first
heavy blobs of rain began to hit the ground as Arthur tried to
drag himself to some sort of run.
Random reached the crest of the hill and looked down into the
next valley. It had been a longer and harder climb than she had
anticipated. She was a little worried that doing the trip at night
was not that great an idea, but her father had been mooching
around near the hut all day trying to pretend to either her or
himself that he wasn't guarding the parcel. At last he'd had to
go over to the forge to talk with Strinder about the knives, and
Random had seized her opportunity and done a runner with the
parcel.

It was perfectly clear that she couldn't just open the thing
there, in the hut, or even in the village. He might have come
across her at any moment. Which meant that she had to go
where she wouldn't be followed.

She could stop where she was now. She had gone this way
in the hope that he wouldn't follow her. and even if he did he
would never find her up in the wooded parts of the hill with
night drawing in and the rain starting.

All the way up, the parcel had been jiggling under her arm.
It was a satisfyingly hunky sort of thing: a box with a square top
about the length of her forearm on each side, and about the length
of her hand deep, wrapped up in brown plasper with an ingenious
new form of self-knotting string. It didn't rattle as she shook it,
but she sensed that its weight was concentrated excitingly at the
centre.

Having come so far, though, there was a certain satisfaction
in not stopping here, but carrying on down into what seemed to
be almost a forbidden area - where her father's ship had come
down. She wasn't exactly certain what the word haunted' meant,
but it might be fun to find out. She would keep going and save
the parcel up for when she got there.

It was getting darker, though. She hadn't used her tiny electric
torch yet, because she didn't want to be visible from a distance.
She would have to use it now, but it probably didn't matter since
she would be on the other side of the hill which divided the valleys
from each other.

She turned her torch on. Almost at the same moment a fork
of lightning ripped across the valley into which she was heading
and startled her considerably. As the darkness shuddered back
around her and a clap of thunder rolled out across the land she
felt suddenly rather small and lost with just a feeble pencil of
light bobbing in her hand. Perhaps she should stop after all
and open the parcel here. Or maybe she should go back and
come out again tomorrow. It was only a momentary hesitation,
though. She knew there was no going back tonight, and sensed
that there was no going back ever.

She headed on down the side of the hill. The rain was
beginning to pick up now. Where a short while ago it had
been a few heavy blobs it was settling in for a good pour now,
hissing in the trees, and the ground was getting slippery under
her feet.

At least, she thought it was the rain hissing in the trees.
Shadows were leaping and leering at her as her light bobbed
through the trees. Onwards and downwards.

She hurried on for another ten or fifteen minutes, soaked to the
skin now and shivering, and gradually became aware that there
seemed to be some other light somewhere ahead of her. It was
very faint and she wasn't certain if she was imagining it or not.
She turned off her torch to see. There did seem to be some sort
of dim glow ahead. She couldn't tell what it was. She turned her
torch back on and continued down the hill, towards whatever it
was.

There was something wrong with the woods though.

She couldn't immediately say what it was, but they didn't
seem like sprightly healthy woods looking forward to a good
spring. The trees were lolling at sickly angles and had a sort of
pallid, blighted look about them. Random more than once had
the worrying sensation that they were trying to reach towards
her as she passed them, but it was just a trick of the way that
her light caused their shadows to flicker and lurch.

Suddenly, something fell out of a tree in front of her. She
leapt backwards with alarm, dropping both the torch and the
box as she did so. She went down into a crouch, pulling the
specially sharpened rock out of her pocket.

The thing that had fallen out of the tree was moving. The
torch was lying on the ground and pointing towards it, and a
vast, grotesque shadow was slowly lurching through the light
towards her. She could hear faint rustling and screeching noises
over the steady hiss of the rain. She scrabbled on the ground for
the torch, found it, and shone it directly at the creature.

At the same moment another dropped from a tree just a few
feet away. She swung the torch wildly from one to another. She
held her rock up, ready to throw.

They were quite small in fact. It was the angle of the light that
had made them loom so large. Not only small. but small, furry
and cuddly. And there was another, dropping from the trees. It
fell through the beam of light, so she saw it quite clearly.

It fell neatly and precisely, turned, and then, like the other
two, started slowly and purposefully to advance on Random.

She stayed rooted to the spot. She still had her rock. poised
and ready to throw, but was increasingly conscious of the fact
that the things she had it poised and ready to throw at were
squirrels. Or at least, squirrel-like things. Soft, warm, cuddly
squirrel-like things advancing on her in a way she wasn't at all
certain she liked.

She shone her torch directly on the first of them. It was
making aggressive, hectoring, screeching noises, and carrying
in one of its little fists a small tattered piece of wet, pink rag.
Random hefted her rock menacingly in her hand, but it made
no impression at all on the squirrel advancing on her with its
wet piece of rag.

She backed away. She didn't know at all how to deal with this.
If they had been vicious snarling slavering beasts with glistening
fangs she would have pitched into them with a will, but squirrels
behaving like this she couldn't quite handle.

She backed away again. The second squirrel was starting
to make a flanking manoeuvre round to her right. Carrying a
cup. Some kind of acorn thing. The third was right behind it
and making its own advance. What was it carrying? Some little
scrap of soggy paper, Random thought.

She stepped back again, caught her ankle against the root
of a tree and fell over backwards.

Instantly the first squirrel darted forward and was on top of
her, advancing along her stomach with cold purpose. in its eyes,
and a piece of wet rag in its fist.

Random tried to jump up, but only managed to jump about
an inch. The startled movement of the squirrel on her stomach
startled her in return. The squirrel froze, gripping her skin
through her soaking shirt with its tiny claws. Then slowly, inch
by inch, it made its way up her, stopped, and proffered her the
rag.

She felt almost hypnotised by the strangeness of the thing and
its tiny glinting eyes. It proffered her the rag again. It pushed it
at her repeatedly, screeching insistently, till at last, nervously,
hesitantly, she took the thing from it. It continued to watch her
intently, its eyes darting all over her face . She had no idea what
to do. Rain and mud were streaming down her face and she had
a squirrel sitting on her. She wiped some mud out of her eyes
with the rag.

The squirrel shrieked triumphantly, grabbed the rag hack,
leapt off her, ran scampering into the dark, enclosing night,
darted up into a tree, dived into a hole in the trunk, settled
back and lit a cigarette.

Meanwhile Random was trying to fend off the squirrel with
the acorn cup full of rain and the one with the paper. She
shuffled backwards on her bottom.

No!' she shouted. Go away!'

They darted back, in fright, and then darted right forward
again with their gifts. She brandished her rock at them. Go!'
she yelled.

The squirrels scampered round in consternation. Then one
darted straight at her, dropped the acorn cup in her lap, turned
and ran off into the night. The other stood quivering for a
moment, then put its scrap of paper neatly down in front of
her and disappeared as well.

She was alone again, but trembling with confusion. She got
unsteadily to her feet, picked up her rock and her parcel, then
paused and picked up the scrap of paper as well. It was so soggy
and dilapidated it was hard to make out what it was. It seemed
just to be a fragment of an in-flight magazine.

Just as Random was trying to understand exactly what it was
that this all meant, a man walked out into the clearing in which
she was standing, raised a vicious-looking gun and shot her.
Arthur was thrashing around hopelessly two or three miles
behind her, on the upward side of the hill.

Within minutes of setting out he had gone back again and
equipped himself with a lamp. Not an electric one. The only
electric light in the place was the one that Random had brought
with her. This was a kind of dim hurricane lamp: a perforated
metal canister from Strinder's forge, which contained a reservoir
of inflammable fish oil, a wick of knotted dried grass and was
wrapped in a translucent film made from dried membranes from
the gut of a Perfectly Normal Beast.

It had now gone out.

Arthur jiggled around with it in a thoroughly pointless kind
of a way for a few seconds. There was clearly no way he was
going to get the thing suddenly to burst into flame again in the
middle of a rainstorm, but it's impossible not to make a token
effort. Reluctantly he threw the thing aside.

What to do? This was hopeless. He was absolutely sodden,
his clothes heavy and billowing with the rain, and now he was
lost in the dark as well.

For a brief second he was lost in the blinding light, and
then he was lost in the dark again.

The sheet of lightning had at least shown him that he was
very close to the brow of the hill. Once he had breasted that
he would... well, he wasn't certain what he would do. He'd
have to work that out when he got there.

He limped forward and upwards.

A few minutes later he knew that he was standing panting at
the top. There was some kind of dim glow in the distance below
him. He had no idea what it was, and indeed he hardly liked to
think. It was the only thing he had to make towards, though,
so he started to make his way, stumbling, lost and frightened
towards it.
The flash of lethal light passed straight through Random and,
about two seconds later, so did the man who had shot it. Other
than that he paid her no attention whatsoever. He had shot
someone standing behind her, and when she turned to look,
he was kneeling over the body and going through its pockets.

The tableau froze and vanished. It was replaced a second
later by a giant pair of teeth framed by immense and perfectly
glossed red lips. A huge blue brush appeared out of nowhere
and started foamily to scrub at the teeth, which continued to
hang there gleaming in the shimmering curtain of rain.

Random blinked at it twice before she got it.

It was a commercial. The guy who had shot her was part
of a holographic in-flight movie. She must now be very close to
where the ship had crashed. Obviously some of its systems were
more indestructible than others.

The next half-mile of the journey was particularly trouble-
some. Not only did she have the cold and the rain and the night
to contend with, but also the fractured and thrashing remains of
the ship's on-board entertainment system. Spaceships and jetcars
and helipods crashed and exploded continuously around her,
illuminating the night, villainous people in strange hats smug-
gled dangerous drugs through her, and the combined orchestra
and chorus of the Hallapolis State Opera performed the closing
March of the AnjaQantine Star Guard from Act IV of Rizgar's
Blamwellamum of Woont in a little glade somewhere off to her
left.

And then she was standing on the lip of a very nasty looking and
bubbly-edged crater. There was still a faint warm glow coming
from what would otherwise have looked like an enormous piece
of caramelised chewing gum in the centre of the pit: the melted
remains of a great spaceship.

She stood looking at it for a longish while, and then at
last started to walk along and around the edge of the crater.
She was no longer certain what she was looking for, but kept
moving anyway, keeping the horror of the pit to her left.

The rain was beginning to ease off a little, but it was still
extremely wet, and since she didn't know what it was that was
in the box, whether it was perhaps something delicate or dam-
ageable, she thought she ought to find somewhere reasonably dry
to open it. She hoped she hadn't already damaged it by dropping
it.

She played her torch around the surrounding trees, which were
thin on the ground here, and mostly charred and broken. In the
middle distance she thought she could see a jumbled outcrop of
rock which might provide some shelter, and she started to pick
her way towards it. All around she found the detritus that had
been ejected from the ship as it broke up, before the final fireball.

After she had moved two or three hundred yards from the
edge of the crater she came across the tattered fragments of some
fluffy pink material, sodden, muddied and drooping amongst the
broken trees. She guessed, correctly, that this must be the remains
of the escape cocoon that had saved her father's life. She went and
looked at it more closely, and then noticed something close to it
on the ground, half covered in mud.

She picked it up and wiped the mud off it. It was some kind of
electronic device the size of a small book. Feebly glowing on its
cover, in response to her touch, were some large friendly letters.
They said DON'T PANIC. She knew what this was. It was her
father's copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

She felt instantly reassured by it, turned her head up to the
thundery sky and let some. rain wash over her face and into her
mouth.

She shook her head and hurried on towards the rocks. Clamber-
ing up and over them she almost immediately found the perfect
thing. The mouth of a cave. She played her torch into its inte-
rior. It seemed to be dry and safe. Picking her way carefully,
she walked in. It was quite spacious, but didn't go that deep.
Exhausted and relieved she sat on a convenient rock, put the
box down in front of her and started immediately to open it.

For a long period of time there was much speculation and
controversy about where the so-called missing matter' of the
Universe had got to. All over the Galaxy the science depart-
ments of all the major universities were acquiring more and
more elaborate equipment to probe and search the hearts of
distant galaxies, and then the very centre and the very edges of
the whole Universe, but when eventually it was tracked down it
turned out in fact to he all the stuff which the equipment had
been packed in.

There was quite a large quantity of missing matter in the
box, little soft round white pellets of missing matter, which
Random discarded for future generations of physicists to track
down and discover all over again once the findings of the
current generation of physicists had been lost and forgotten
about.

Out of the pellets of missing matter she lifted the featureless
black disk. She put it down on a rock beside her and sifted
amongst all the missing matter to see if there was anything
else, a manual or some attachments or something, but there
was nothing else at all. Just the black disk.

She shone the torch on it.

As she did so, cracks began to appear along its apparently
featureless surface. Random backed away nervously, but then
saw that the thing, whatever it was, was merely unfolding itself.

The process was wonderfully beautiful. It was extraordinarily
elaborate but also simple and elegant. It was like a piece of
self-opening origami, or a rosebud blooming into a rose in just
a few seconds.

Where just a few moments earlier there had been a smoothly
curved black disk there was now a bird. A bird, hovering there.

Random continued to back away from it, carefully and watch-
fully.

It was a little like a pikka bird, only rather smaller. That is
to say, in fact it was larger, or to be more exact, precisely the
same size or, at least, not less than twice the size. It was also
both a lot bluer and a lot pinker than pikka birds, while at the
same time being perfectly black.

There was also something very odd about it, which Random
couldn't immediately make out.

It certainly shared with pikka birds the impression it gave
that it was watching something that you couldn't see.

Suddenly it vanished.

Then, just as suddenly everything went black. Random drop-
ped into a tense crouch, feeling for the specially sharpened rock
in her pocket again. Then the blackness receded and rolled itself
up into a ball and then the blackness was the bird again. It hung
in the air in front of her, beating its wings slowly and staring at
her.

Excuse me,' it said suddenly, I just have to calibrate myself.
Can you hear me when I say this?'

When you say what?' demanded Random.

Good,' said the bird. And can you hear me when I say
this?' It spoke this time at a much higher pitch.

Yes, of course I can!' said Random.

And can you hear me when I say this?' it said, this time
in a sepulchrally deep voice.

Yes!'

There was then a pause.

No obviously not,' said the bird after a few seconds. Good,
well your hearing range is obviously between and KHz. So.
Is this comfortable for you?' it said in a pleasant light tenor. No
uncomfortable harmonics screeching away in the upper register?
Obviously not. Good. I can use those as data channels. Now.
How many of me can you see?'

Suddenly the air was full of nothing but interlocking birds.
Random was well used to spending time in virtual realities, but
this was something far weirder than anything she had previously
encountered. It was as if the whole geometry of space was
redefined in seamless bird shapes.

Random gasped and flung her arms round her face, her
arms moving through bird-shaped space.

Hmmm, obviously way too many,' said the bird. How about
now?'

It concertina-ed into a tunnel of birds, as if it was a bird
caught between parallel mirrors, reflecting infinitely into the
distance.

What are you?' shouted Random.

We'll come to that in a minute,' said the bird. Just how
many, please?'

Well, you're sort of...' Random gestured helplessly off
into the distance.

I see, still infinite in extent, but at least we're homing in
on the right dimensional matrix. Good. No, the answer is an
orange and two lemons.'

Lemons?'

If I have three lemons and three oranges and I lose two
oranges and a lemon what do I have left?'

Huh?'

OK, so you think that time flows that way, do you? Interesting.
Am I still infinite?' it asked, ballooning this way and that in space.
Am I infinite now? How yellow am I?'

Moment by moment the bird was going through mind-mangling
transformations of shape and extent.

I can't...' said Random bewildered.

You don't have to answer, I can tell from watching you
now. So. Am I your mother? Am I a rock? Do I seem huge,
squishy and sinuously intertwined? No? How about now? Am
I going backwards?'

For once the bird was perfectly still and steady.

No,' Said Random.

Well I was in fact, I was moving backwards in time. Hmmm.
Well I think we've sorted all that out now. If you'd like to know,
I can tell you that in your universe you move freely in three
dimensions that you call space. You move in a straight line in
a fourth, which you call time, and stay rooted to one place in a
fifth, which is the first fundamental of probability. After that it
gets a hit complicated, and there's all sorts of stuff going on in
dimensions to that you really wouldn't want to know about.
All you really need to know for the moment is that the universe
is a lot more complicated than you might think, even if you start
from a position of thinking it's pretty damn complicated in the
first place. I can easily not say words like damn'' if it offends
you.'

Say what you damn well like.'

I will.'

What the hell are you?' demanded Random.

I am The Guide. In your universe I am your Guide. In fact I
inhabit what is technically known as the Whole Sort of General
Mish Mash which means... well, let me show you.'

It turned in mid-air and swooped out of the cave, and then
perched on a rock, just beneath an overhang, out of the rain,
which was getting heavier again.

Come on,' it said, watch this.'

Random didn't like being bossed around by a bird, but she
followed it to the mouth of the cave anyway, still fingering the
rock in her pocket.

Rain,' said the bird. You see? Just rain.'

I know what rain is.'

Sheets of the stuff were sweeping through the night, moonlight
sifting through it.

So what is it?'

What do you mean, what is it? Look, who are you? What
were you doing in that box? Why have I spent a night running
through the forest fending off demented squirrels to find that
all I've got at the end of it is a bird asking me what rain
is. It's just water falling through the bloody air, that's what
it is. Anything else you want to know or can we go home
now?'

There was a long pause before the bird answered, You
want to go home?'

I haven't got a home!' Random almost shocked herself,
she screamed the words so loudly.

Look into the rain...' said the bird Guide.

I'm looking into the rain! What else is there to look at?'

What do you see?'

What do you mean, you stupid bird? I just see a load
of rain. It's just water, falling.'

What shapes do you see in the water?'

Shapes? There aren't any shapes. It's just, just...'

Just a mish mash,' said the bird Guide.

Yes...'

Now what do you see?'

Just on the very edge of visibility a thin faint beam fanned out
of the bird's eyes. In the dry air beneath the overhang there was
nothing to see. Where the beam hit the drops of rain as they fell
through it, there was a flat sheet of light, so bright and vivid it
seemed solid.

Oh great. A laser show,' said Random fractiously. Never
seen one of those before, of course, except at about five million
rock concerts.'

Tell me what you see!'

Just a flat sheet! Stupid bird.'

There's nothing there that wasn't there before. I'm just using
light to draw your attention to certain drops at certain moments.
Now what do you see?'

The light shut off.

Nothing.'

I'm doing exactly the same thing, but with ultra-violet light.
You can't see it.'

So what's the point of showing me something I can't see?'

So that you understand that just because you see something,
it doesn't mean to say it's there. And if you don't see something
it doesn't mean to say it's not there, it's only what your senses
bring to your attention.'

I'm bored with this,' said Random, and then gasped.

Hanging in the rain was a giant and very vivid three-dimen-
sional image of her father looking startled about something.
About two miles away behind Random, her father, struggling
his way through the woods suddenly stopped. He was startled to
see an image of himself looking startled about something hanging
brightly in the rain-filled air about two miles away. About two
miles away some distance to the right of the direction in which
he was heading.

He was almost completely lost, convinced he was going to die
of cold and wet and exhaustion and beginning to wish he could
just get on with it. He had just been brought an entire golfing
magazine by a squirrel, as well, and his brain. was beginning to
howl and gibber.

Seeing a huge bright image of himself light up in the sky told
him that, on balance, he was probably right to howl and gibber
but probably wrong as far as the direction he was heading was
concerned.

Taking a deep breath, he turned and headed off towards
the inexplicable light show.
OK, so what's that supposed to prove?' demanded Random. It
was the fact that the image was her father that had startled her
rather than the appearance of the image itself. She had seen her
first hologram when she was two months old and had been put in
it to play. She had seen her most recent one about half an hour
ago playing the March of the AnjaQantine Star Guard.

Only that it's no more there or not there than the sheet
was,' said the bird. It's just the interaction of water from the
sky moving in one direction, with light at frequencies your senses
can detect moving in another. It makes an apparently solid image
in your mind. But it's all just images in the Mish Mash. Here's
another one for you.'

My mother!' said Random.

No,' said the bird.

I know my mother when I see her!'

The image was of a woman emerging from a spacecraft
inside a large, grey hangar-like building. She was being escorted
by a group of tall, thin purplish-green creatures. It was definite-
ly Random's mother. Well, almost definitely. Trillian wouldn't
have been walking quite so uncertainly in low gravity, or looking
around her at a boring old life-support environment with quite
such a disbelieving look on her face, or carrying such a quaint
old camera.

So who is it?' demanded Random.

She is part of the extent of your mother on the probability
axis,' said the bird Guide.

I haven't the faintest idea what you mean.'

Space, time and probability all have axes along which it
is possible to move.'

Still dunno. Though I think... No. Explain.'

I thought you wanted to go home.'

Explain!'

Would you like to see your home?'

See it? It was destroyed!'

It is discontinuous along the probability axis. Look!'

Something very strange and wonderful now swam into view
in the rain. It was a huge, bluish-greenish globe, misty and
cloud-covered, turning with. majestic slowness against a black,
starry background.

Now you see it,' said the bird. Now you don't.'
A little less than two miles away, now, Arthur Dent stood still
in his tracks. He could not believe what he could see, hanging
there, shrouded in rain, but brilliant and vividly real against the
night sky - the Earth. He gasped at the sight of it. Then, at the
moment he gasped, it disappeared again. Then it appeared again.
Then, and this was the bit that made him give up and stick straws
in his hair, it turned into a sausage.
Random was also startled by the sight of this huge, blue and
green and watery and misty sausage hanging above her. And
now it was a string of sausages, or rather it was a string of
sausages in which many of the sausages were missing. The whole
brilliant string turned and span in a bewildering dance in the
air and then gradually slowed, grew insubstantial and faded into
the glistening darkness of the night.

What was that?' asked Random, in a small voice.

A glimpse along the probability axis of a discontinuously
probable object.'

I see.'

Most objects mutate and change along their axis of prob-
ability, but the world of your origin does something slightly
different. It lies on what you might call a fault line in the
landscape of probability which means that at many probability
co-ordinates, the whole of it simply ceases to exist. It has an
inherent instability, which is typical of anything that lies within
what are usually designated the Plural sectors. Make sense?'

No.'

Want to go and see for yourself?'

To... Earth?'

Yes.'

Is that possible?'

The bird Guide did not answer at once. It spread its wings
and, with an easy grace, ascended into the air and flew out into
the rain which, once again, was beginning to lighten.

It soared ecstatically up into the night sky, lights flashed
around it, dimensions dithered in its wake. It swooped and
turned and looped and turned again and came at last to rest
two feet in front of Random's face, its wings beating slowly and
silently.

It spoke to her again.

Your universe is vast to you. Vast in time, vast in space.
That's because of the filters through which you perceive it. But
I was built with no filters at all, which means I perceive the mish
mash which contains all possible universes but which has, itself,
no size at all. For me, anything is possible. I am omniscient
and omnipotent, extremely vain, and, what is more, I come in
a handy self-carrying package. You have to work out how much
of the above is true.'

A slow smile spread over Random's face.

You bloody little thing. You've been winding me up!'

As I said, anything is possible.'

Random laughed. OK,' she said. Let's try and go to Earth.
Let's go to Earth at some point on its, er...'

Probability axis?'

Yes. Where it hasn't been blown up. OK. So you're the
Guide. How do we get a lift?'

Reverse engineering.'

What?'

Reverse engineering. To me the flow of time is irrelevant.
You decide what you want. I then merely make sure that it has
already happened.'

You're joking.'

Anything is possible.'

Random frowned. You are joking aren't you?'

Let me put it another way,' said the bird. Reverse engineering
enables us to shortcut all the business of waiting for one of the
horribly few spaceships that passes through your galactic sector
every year or so to make up its mind about whether or not it
feels like giving you a lift. You want a lift a ship arrives and
gives you one. The pilot may think he has any one of a million
reasons why he has decided to stop and pick you up. The real
reason is that I have determined that he will.'

This is you being extremely vain isn't it, little bird?'

The bird was silent.

OK,' said Random. I want a ship to take me to Earth.'

Will this one do?'

It was so silent that Random had not noticed the descending
spaceship until it was nearly on top of her.
Arthur had noticed it. He was a mile away now and closing. Just
after the illuminated sausage display had drawn to its conclusion
he had noticed the faint glimmerings of further lights coming
down out of the clouds and had, to begin with, assumed it to
be another piece of flashy son et lumiere.

It took a moment or so for it to dawn on him that it was
an actual spaceship, and a moment or two longer for him to
realise that it was dropping directly down to where he assumed
his daughter to be. That was when, rain or no rain, leg injury
or no leg injury, darkness or no darkness, he suddenly started
really to run.

He fell almost immediately, slid and hurt his knee quite badly
on a rock. He slithered back up to his feet and tried again. He
had a horrible cold feeling that he was about to lose Random
for ever. Limping and cursing, he ran. He didn't know what it
was that had been in the box, but the name on it had been Ford
Prefect, and that was the name he cursed as he ran.
The ship was one of the sexiest and most beautiful ones that
Random had ever seen.

It was astounding. Silver, sleek, ineffable.

If she didn't know better she would have said it was an RW.
As it settled silently beside her she realised that it actually was
an RW and she could scarcely breathe for excitement. An RW
was the sort of thing you only saw in the sort of magazines that
were designed to provoke civil unrest.

She was also extremely nervous. The manner and timing of
its arrival was deeply unsettling. Either it was the most bizarre
coincidence or something very peculiar and worrying was going
on. She waited a little tensely for the ship's hatch to open. Her
Guide - she thought of it as hers now - was hovering lightly over
her right shoulder, its wings barely fluttering.

The hatch opened. Just a little dim light escaped. A moment
or two passed and a figure emerged. He stood still for a moment
or so, obviously trying to accustom his eyes to the darkness.
Then he caught sight of Random standing there, and seemed a
little surprised. He started to walk towards her. Then suddenly
he shouted in surprise and started to run at her.

Random was not a good person to take a run at on a
dark night when she was feeling a little strung out. She had
unconsciously been fingering the rock in her pocket from the
moment she saw the craft coming down.
Still running, slithering, hurtling, bumping into trees, Arthur
saw at last that he was too late. The ship had only been on the
ground for about three minutes, and now, silently, gracefully it
was rising up above the trees again, turning smoothly in the fine
speckle of rain to which the storm had now abated, climbing,
climbing, tipping up its nose and, suddenly, effortlessly, hurtling
up through the clouds.

Gone. Random was in it. It was impossible for Arthur to
know this, but he just went ahead and knew it anyway. She was
gone. He had had his stint at being a parent and could scarcely
believe how badly he had done at it. He tried to continue run-
ning, but his feet were dragging, his knee was hurting like fury
and he knew that he was too late.

He could not conceive that he could feel more wretched
and awful than this, but he was wrong.

He limped his way at last to the cave where Random had
sheltered and opened the box. The ground bore the indentations
of the spacecraft that had landed there only minutes before, but
of Random there was no sign. He wandered disconsolately into
the cave, found the empty box and piles of missing matter pellets
strewn around the place. He felt a little cross about that. He'd
tried to teach her about cleaning up after herself. Feeling a bit
cross with her about something like that helped him feel less
desolate about her leaving. He knew he had no means of finding
her.

His foot knocked against something unexpected. He bent
down to pick it up, and was thoroughly surprised to discover
what it was. It was his old Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
How did that come to be in the cave? He had never returned
to collect it from the scene of the crash. He had not wanted to
revisit the crash and he had not wanted the Guide again. He had
reckoned he was here on Lamuella, making sandwiches for good.
How did it come to be in the cave? It was active. The words on
the cover flashed DON'T PANIC at him.

He went out of the cave again into the dim and damp
moonlight. He sat on a rock to have a look through the old
Guide, and then discovered it wasn't a rock, it was a person.

Arthur leapt to his feet with a start of fear. It would be
hard to say which he was more frightened of: that he. might
have hurt the person he had inadvertently sat on or that the
person he had inadvertently sat on would hurt him back.

There seemed, on inspection, to be little immediate cause for
alarm on the second count. Whoever it was he had sat on was
unconscious. That would probably go a great deal of the way
towards explaining what he was doing lying there. He seemed to
be breathing OK, though. Arthur felt his pulse. That was OK as
well.

He was lying on his side, half curled up. It was so long ago
and far away when Arthur had last done First Aid that he really
couldn't remember what it was he was supposed to do. The first
thing he was supposed to do, he remembered, was to have a First
Aid kit about his person. Damn.

Should he roll him on to his back or not? Suppose he had
any broken bones? Suppose he swallowed his tongue? Suppose
he sued him? Who, apart from anything else, was he?

At that moment the unconscious man groaned loudly and
rolled himself over.

Arthur wondered if he should -

He looked at him.

He looked at him again.

He looked at him again, just to make absolutely sure.

Despite the fact that he had been thinking he was feeling
about as low as he possibly could, he experienced a terrible
sinking feeling.

The figure groaned again and slowly opened his eyes. It
took him a while to focus, then he blinked and stiffened.

You!' said Ford Prefect.

You!' said Arthur Dent.

Ford groaned again.

What do you need to have explained this time?' he said,
and closed his eyes in some kind of despair. Five minutes later he was sitting up and rubbing the side
of his head, where he had quite a large swelling.

Who the hell was that woman?' he said. Why are we sur-
rounded by squirrels, and what do they want?'

I've been pestered by squirrels all night,' said Arthur. They
keep on trying to give me magazines and stuff.'

Ford frowned. Really?' he said.

And bits of rag.'

Ford thought.

Oh,' he said. Is this near where your ship crashed?'

Yes,' said Arthur. He said it a little tightly.

That's probably it. Can happen. Ship's cabin robots get
destroyed. The cyberminds that control them survive and start
infesting the local wildlife. Can turn a whole ecosystem into some
kind of helpless thrashing service industry, handing out hot towels
and drinks to passers-by. Should be a law against it. Probably is.
Probably also a law against there being a law against it so every-
body can get nice and worked up. Hey ho. What did you say?'

I said, and the woman is my daughter.'

Ford stopped rubbing his head.

Say that one more time.'

I said,' said Arthur huffily, the woman is my daughter.'

I didn't know,' said Ford, that you had a daughter.'

Well, there's probably a lot you don't know about me,'
said Arthur. Come to mention it, there's probably a lot I
don't know about me either.'

Well, well, well. When did this happen then?'

I'm not quite sure.'

That sounds like more familiar territory,' said Ford. Is there
a mother involved?'

Trillian.'

Trillian? I didn't think that...'

No. Look, it's a bit embarrassing.'

I remember she told me once she had a kid but only, sort
of, in passing. I'm in touch with her from time to time. Never
seen her with the kid.'

Arthur said nothing.

Ford started to feel the side of his head again in some
bemusement.

Are you sure this was your daughter?' he said.

Tell me what happened.'

Phroo. Long story. I was coming to pick up this parcel
I'd sent to myself here care of you...'

Well, what was that all about?'

I think it may be something unimaginably dangerous.'

And you sent it to me?' protested Arthur.

Safest place I could think of. I thought I could rely on you
to be absolutely boring and not open it. Anyway, coming in at
night I couldn't find this village place. I was going by pretty basic
information. I couldn't find any signal of any kind. I guess you
don't have signals and stuff here.'

That's what I like about it.'

Then I did pick up a faint signal from your old copy of the
Guide, so I homed in on that, thinking that would take me to
you. I found I'd landed in some kind of wood. Couldn't figure
out what was going on. I get out, and then see this woman
standing there. I go up to say hello, then suddenly I see that
she's got this thing!'

What thing?'

The thing I sent you! The new Guide! The bird thing! You
were meant to keep it safe, you idiot, but this woman had the
thing right there by her shoulder. I ran forward and she hit me
with a rock.'

I see,' said Arthur. What did you do?'

Well, I fell over of course. I was very badly hurt. She and
the bird started to make off towards my ship. And when I say
my ship, I mean an RW.'

A what?'

An RW for Zark's sake. I've got this great relationship
going now between my credit card and the Guide's central
computer. You would not believe that ship, Arthur, it's...'

So an RW is a spaceship, then?'

Yes! It's - oh never mind. Look, just get some kind of
grip will you, Arthur? Or at least get some kind of catalogue.
At this point I was very worried. And, I think, semi-concussed.
I was down on my knees and bleeding profusely, so I did the
only thing I could think of, which was to beg. I said, please for
Zark's sake don't take my ship. And don't leave me stranded in
the middle of some primitive zarking forest with no medical help
and a head injury. I could be in serious trouble and so could she.'

What did she say?'

She hit me on the head with the rock again.'

I think I can confirm that that was my daughter.'

Sweet kid.'

You have to get to know her,' said Arthur.

She eases up does she?'

No,' said Arthur, but you get a better sense of when to duck.'

Ford held his head and tried to see straight.

The sky was beginning to lighten in the west, which was
where the sun rose. Arthur didn't particularly want to see
it. The last thing he wanted after a hellish night like this
one was some blasted day coming along and barging about the
place.

What are you doing in a place like this, Arthur?' demanded
Ford.

Well,' said Arthur, making sandwiches mostly.'

What?'

I am, probably was, the sandwich maker for a small tribe. It
was a bit embarrassing really. When I first arrived, that is, when
they rescued me from the wreckage of this super high-technology
spacecraft which had crashed on their planet, they were very nice
to me and I thought I should help them out a bit. You know, I'm
an educated chap from a high-technology culture, I could show
them a thing or two. And of course I couldn't. I haven't got the
faintest idea, when it comes down to it, of how anything actually
works. I don't mean like video-recorders, nobody knows how to
work those. I mean just something like a pen or an artesian well
or something. Not the foggiest. I couldn't help at all. One day
I got glum and made myself a sandwich. That suddenly got
them all excited. They'd never seen one before. It was just
an idea that had never occurred to them, and I happen to
quite like making sandwiches, so it all sort of developed from
there.'

And you enjoyed that?'

Well, yes, I think I sort of did, really. Getting a good
set of knives, that sort of thing.'

You didn't, for instance, find it mind-witheringly, explosively,
astoundingly, blisteringly dull?'

Well, er, no. Not as such. Not actually blisteringly.'

Odd. I would.'

Well, I suppose we have a different outlook.'

Yes.'

Like the pikka birds.'

Ford had no idea what he was talking about and couldn't
be bothered to ask. Instead he said, So how the hell do we
get out of this place?'

Well I think the simplest way from here is just to follow the
way down the valley to the plains, probably take an hour, and
then walk round from there. I don't think I could face going
back up and over the way I came.'

Walk round where from there?'

Well, back to the village. I suppose.' Arthur sighed a little
forlornly.

I don't want to go to any blasted village!' snapped Ford.

We've got to get out of here!'

Where? How?'

I don't know, you tell me. You live here! There must be
some way off this zarking planet.'

I don't know. What do you usually do? Sit around and
wait for a passing spacecraft, I suppose.'

Oh yes? And how many spacecraft have visited this zark-
forsaken little fleapit recently?'

Well, a few years ago there was mine that crashed here by
mistake. Then there was, er, Trillian, then the parcel delivery,
and now you, and...'

Yes, but apart from the usual suspects?'

Well, er, I think pretty much none, so far as I know. Pretty
quiet round here.'

As if deliberately to prove him wrong, there was a long,
low distant roll of thunder.

Ford leapt to his feet fretfully and started pacing backwards
and forwards in the feeble, painful light of the early dawn which
lay streaked against the sky as if someone had dragged a piece
of liver across it.

You don't understand how important this is,' he said.

What? You mean my daughter out there all alone in the
Galaxy? You think I don't...'

Can we feel sorry for the Galaxy later?' said Ford. This is
very, very serious indeed. The Guide has been taken over. It's
been bought out.'

Arthur leapt up. Oh very serious,' he shouted. Please fill
me in straight away on some corporate publishing politics! I
can't tell you how much it's been on my mind of late!'

You don't understand! There's a whole new Guide!'

Oh!' shouted Arthur again. Oh! Oh! Oh! I'm incoherent
with excitement! I can hardly wait for it to come out to find
out which are the most exciting spaceports to get bored hanging
about in in some globular cluster I've never heard of. Please,
can we rush to a store that's got it right this very instant?'

Ford narrowed his eyes.

This is that thing you call sarcasm, isn't it?'

Do you know,' bellowed Arthur, I think it is? I really think
it might just be a crazy little thing called sarcasm seeping in at
the edges of my manner of speech! Ford, I have had a fucking
bad night! Will you please try and take that into account while you
consider what fascinating bits of badger-sputumly inconsequential
trivia to assail me with next?'

Try to rest,' said Ford. I need to think.'

Why do you need to think? Can't we just sit and go budum-
budumbudum with our lips for a bit? Couldn't we just dribble
gently and loll a little bit to the left for a few minutes? I can't
stand it, Ford! I can't stand all this thinking and trying to work
things out any more. You may think that I am just standing here
barking...'

Hadn't occurred to me in fact.'

...but I mean it! What is the point? We assume that
every time we do anything we know what the consequences
will be, i.e., more or less what we intend them to be. This
is not only not always correct. It is wildly, crazily, stupidly
cross-eyed-blithering-insectly wrong!'

Which is exactly my point.'

Thank you,' said Arthur, sitting down again. What?'

Temporal reverse engineering.'

Arthur put his head in his hands and shook it gently from
side to side.

Is there any humane way,' he moaned, in which I can prevent
you from telling me what temporary reverse bloody-whatsiting is?'

No,' said Ford, because your daughter is caught up in the
middle of it and it is deadly, deadly serious.'

Thunder rolled in the pause.

All right,' said Arthur. Tell me.'

I leaped out of a high-rise office window.'

This cheered Arthur up.

Oh!' he said. Why don't you do it again?'

I did.'

Hmmm,' said Arthur, disappointed. Obviously no good came
of it.'

The first time I managed to save myself by the most astonish-
ing and - I say this in all modesty - fabulous piece of ingenious
quick-thinking, agility, fancy footwork and self-sacrifice.'

What was the self-sacrifice?'

I jettisoned half of a much loved and I think irreplaceable
pair of shoes.'

Why was that self-sacrifice?'

Because they were mine!' said Ford crossly.

I think we have different value systems.'

Well mine's better.'

That's according to your... oh never mind. So having saved
yourself very cleverly once you very sensibly went and jumped
again. Please don't tell me why. Just tell me what happened if
you must.'

I fell straight into the open cockpit of a passing jet towncar
whose pilot had just accidentally pushed the eject button when he
meant only to change tracks on the stereo. Now, even I couldn't
think that that was particularly clever of me.'

Oh, I don't know,' said Arthur wearily. I expect you probably
sneaked into his jetcar the previous night and set the pilot's least
favourite track to play or something.'

No, I didn't,' said Ford.

Just checking.'

Though oddly enough, somebody else did. And this is the
nub. You could trace the chain and branches of crucial events
and coincidences back and back. Turned out the new Guide had
done it. That bird.'

What bird?'

You haven't seen it?'

No.'

Oh. It's a lethal little thing. Looks pretty, talks big, collapses
waveforms selectively at will.'

What does that mean?'

Temporal reverse engineering.'

Oh,' said Arthur. Oh yes.'

The question is, who is it really doing it for?'

I've actually got a sandwich in my pocket,' said Arthur,
delving. Would you like a bit?'

Yeah, OK.'

It's a bit squished and sodden, I'm afraid.'

Never mind.'

They munched for a bit.

It's quite good in fact,' said Ford. What's the meat in it?'

Perfectly Normal Beast.'

Not come across that one. So, the question is,' Ford con-
tinued, who is the bird really doing it for? What's the real game
here?'

Mmm,' ate Arthur.

When I found the bird,' continued Ford, which I did by a
series of coincidences that are interesting in themselves, it put
on the most fantastic multi-dimensional display of pyrotechnics
I've ever seen. It then said that it would put its services at my
disposal in my universe. I said, thanks but no thanks. It said that
it would anyway, whether I liked it or not. I said just try it, and
it said it would and, indeed, already had done. I said we'd see
about that and it said that we would. That's when I decided to
pack the thing up and get it out of there. So I sent it to you for
safety.'

Oh yes? Whose?'

Never you mind. Then, what with one thing and another,
I thought it prudent to jump out of the window again, being
fresh out of other options at the time. Luckily for me the jetcar
was there otherwise I would have had to fall back on ingenious
quick-thinking, agility, maybe another shoe or, failing all else,
the ground. But it meant that, whether I liked it or not, the
Guide was, well, working for me, and that was deeply worrying.'

Why?'

Because if you've got the Guide you think that you are the
one it's working for. Everything went swimmingly smoothly for
me from then on, up to the very moment that I come up against
the totty with the rock, then, bang, I'm history. I'm out of the
loop.'

Are you referring to my daughter?'

As politely as I can. She's the next one in the chain who will
think that everything is going fabulously for her. She can beat
whoever she likes around the head with bits of the landscape,
everything will just swim for her until she's done whatever she's
supposed to do and then it will be all up for her too. It's reverse
temporal engineering, and clearly nobody understood what was
being unleashed!'

Like me for instance.'

What? Oh, wake up, Arthur. Look, let me try it again.
The new Guide came out of the research labs. It made use
of this new technology of Unfiltered Perception. Do you know
what that means?'

Look, I've been making sandwiches for Bob's sake!'

Who's Bob?'

Never mind. Just carry on.'

Unfiltered Perception means it perceives everything. Got
that? I don't perceive everything. You don't perceive everything.
We have filters. The new Guide doesn't have any sense filters. It
perceives everything. It wasn't a complicated technological idea.
It was just a question of leaving a bit out. Got it?'

Why don't I just say that I've got it, and then you can
carry on regardless.'

Right. Now because the bird can perceive every possible
Universe. it is present in every possible universe. Yes?'

Y... e... e... s. Ish.'

So what happens is, the bozos in the marketing and account-
ing departments say, oh that sounds good, doesn't that mean
we only have to make one of them and then sell it an infinite
number of times? Don't squint at me like that, Arthur, this is
how accountants think!'

That's quite clever, isn't it?'

No! It is fantastically stupid. Look. The machine's only a
little Guide. It's got some quite clever cybertechnology in it,
but because it has Unfiltered Perception, any smallest move it
makes has the power of a virus. It can propagate throughout
space, time and a million other dimensions. Anything can be
focused anywhere in any of the universes that you and I move in.
Its power is recursive. Think of a computer program. Somewhere,
there is one key instruction, and everything else is just functions
calling themselves, or brackets billowing out endlessly through an
infinite address space. What happens when the brackets collapse?
Where's the final end if''? Is any of this making sense? Arthur?'

Sorry, I was nodding off for a moment. Something about
the Universe, yes?'

Something about the Universe, yes,' said Ford, wearily. He
sat down again.

All right,' he said. Think about this. You know who I think
I saw at the Guide offices? Vogons. Ah. I see I've said a word
you understand at last.'

Arthur leapt to his feet.

That noise,' he said.

What noise?'

The thunder.'

what about it?'

It isn't thunder. It's the spring migration of the Perfectly
Normal Beasts. It's started.'

What are these animals you keep on about?'

I don't keep on about them. I just put bits of them in
sandwiches.'

Why are they called Perfectly Normal Beasts?'

Arthur told him.

It wasn't often that Arthur had the pleasure of seeing Ford's
eyes open wide with astonishment.

It was a sight that Arthur never quite got used to, or tired of.
He and Ford had tracked their way swiftly along the side of the
small river that flowed down along the bed of the valley, and
when at last they reached the margin of the plains they pulled
themselves up into the branches of a large tree to get a better
view of one of the stranger and more wonderful visions that the
Galaxy has to offer.

The great thunderous herd of thousand upon thousand of
Perfectly Normal Beasts was sweeping in magnificent array across
the Anhondo Plain. In the early pale light of the morning, as the
great animals charged through the fine steam of the sweat of
their bodies mingled with the muddy mist churned up by their
pounding hooves, their appearance seemed a little unreal and
ghostly anyway, but what was heart-stopping about them was
where they came from and where they went to, which appeared
to be, simply, nowhere.

They formed a solid, charging phalanx roughly a hundred yards
wide and half a mile long. The phalanx never moved, except that
it exhibited a slight gradual drift sideways and backwards for the
eight or nine days that it regularly appeared for. But though the
phalanx stayed more or less constant, the great beasts of which
it was composed charged steadily at upwards of twenty miles an
hour, appearing suddenly from thin air at one end of the plain,
and disappearing equally abruptly at the other end.

No one knew where they came from, no one knew where they
went. They were so important to the lives of the Lamuellans, it
was almost as if nobody liked to ask. Old Thrashbarg had said
on one occasion that some times if you received an answer, the
question might be taken away. Some of the villagers had privately
said that this was the only properly wise thing they'd ever heard
Thrashbarg say, and after a short debate on the matter, had put
it down to chance.

The noise of the pounding of the hooves was so intense
that it was hard to hear anything else above it.

What did you say?' shouted Arthur.

I said,' shouted Ford, this looks like it might be some
kind of evidence of dimensional drift.'

Which is what?' shouted Arthur back.

Well, a lot of people are beginning to worry that space time
is showing signs of cracking up with everything that's happening
to it. There are quite a lot of worlds where you can see how the
landmasses have cracked up and moved around just from the
weirdly long or meandering routes that migrating animals take.
This might be something like that. We live in twisted times. Still,
in the absence of a decent spaceport...'

Arthur looked at him in a kind of frozen way.

What do you mean?' he said.

What do you mean, what do I mean?' shouted Ford. You
know perfectly well what I mean. We're going to ride our way
out of here.'

Are you seriously suggesting we try to ride a Perfectly Normal
Beast?'

Yeah. See where it goes to.'

We'll be killed! No,' said Arthur, suddenly. We won't be
killed. At least I won't. Ford, have you ever heard of a planet
called Stavromula Beta?'

Ford frowned. Don't think so,' he said. He pulled out his
own battered old copy of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy
and accessed it. Any funny spelling?' he said.

Don't know. I've only ever heard it said, and that was
by someone who had a mouthful of other people's teeth. You
remember I told you about Agrajag?'

Ford thought for a moment. You mean the guy who was
convinced you were getting him killed over and over again?'

Yes. One of the places he claimed I'd got him killed was
Stavromula Beta. Someone tries to shoot me, it seems. I duck
and Agrajag, or at least, one of his many reincarnations, gets hit.
It seems that this has definitely happened at some point in time
so, I suppose, I can't get killed at least until after I've ducked
on Stavromula Beta. Only no one's ever heard of it.'

Hmm.' Ford tried a few other searches of the Hitch Hiker's
Guide, but drew a blank.

Nothing,' he said.

I was just... no, I've never heard of it,' said Ford finally.
He wondered why it was ringing a very, very faint bell, though.

OK,' said Arthur. I've seen the way the Lamuellan hunters
trap Perfectly Normal Beasts. If you spear one in the herd it just
gets trampled, so they have to lure them out one at a time for
the kill. It's very like the way a matador works, you know, with
a brightly coloured cape. You get one to charge at you and then
step aside and execute a rather elegant swing through with the
cape. Have you got anything like a brightly coloured cape about
you?'

This do?' said Ford, handing him his towel.

Leaping on to the back of a one-and-a-half-ton Perfectly Normal
Beast migrating through your world at a thundering thirty miles
an hour is not as easy as it might at first seem. Certainly it is
not as easy as the Lamuellan hunters made it seem, and Arthur
Dent was prepared to discover that this might turn out to be the
difficult bit.

What he hadn't been prepared to discover, however, was
how difficult it was even getting to the difficult bit. It was the
bit that was supposed to be the easy bit which turned out to be
practically impossible.

They couldn't even catch the attention of a single animal.
The Perfectly Normal Beasts were so intent on working up a
good thunder with their hooves, heads down shoulders forward,
back legs pounding the ground into porridge that it would have
taken something not merely startling but actually geological to
disturb them.

The sheer amount of thundering and pending was, in the
end, more than Arthur and Ford could deal with. After they had
spent nearly two hours prancing about doing increasingly foolish
things with a medium-sized floral patterned bath towel, they had
not managed to get even one of the great beasts thundering and
pounding past them to do so much as glance casually in their
direction.

They were within three feet of the horizontal avalanche of
sweating bodies. To have been much nearer would have been
to risk instant death, chrono-logic or no chrono-logic. Arthur
had seen what remained of any Perfectly Normal Beast which,
as the result of a clumsy mis-throw by a young and inexperienced
Lamuellan hunter, got speared while still thundering and pound-
ing with the herd.

One stumble was all it took. No prior appointment with death
on Stavromula Beta, wherever the hell Stavromula Beta was,
would save you or anybody else from the thunderous, mangling
pounding of those hooves.

At last, Arthur and Ford staggered back. They sat down,
exhausted and defeated, and started to criticise each other's
technique with the towel.

You've got to flick it more,' complained Ford. You need
more follow-through from the elbow if you're going to get those
blasted creatures to notice anything at all.'

Follow-through?' protested Arthur. You need more supple-
ness in the wrist.'

You need more after-flourish,' countered Ford.

You need a bigger towel.'

You need,' said another voice, a pikka bird.'

You what?'

The voice had come from behind them. They turned, and
there, standing behind them in the early morning sun, was Old
Thrashbarg.

To attract the attention of a Perfectly Normal Beast,' he
said, as he walked forward towards them, you need a pikka
bird. Like this.'

From under the rough, cassocky robe-like thing he wore he
drew a small pikka bird. It sat restlessly on Old Thrashbarg's
hand and peered intently at Bob knows what darting around
about three feet six inches in front of it.

Ford instantly went into the sort of alert crouch he liked to
do when he wasn't quite sure what was going on or what he
ought to do about it. He waved his arms around very slowly
in what he hoped was an ominous manner.

Who is this?' he hissed.

It's just Old Thrashbarg,' said Arthur quietly. And I wouldn't
bother with all the fancy movements. He's just as experienced a
bluffer as you are. You could end up dancing around each other
all day.'

The bird,' hissed Ford again. What's the bird?'

It's just a bird!' said Arthur impatiently. It's like any other
bird. It lays eggs and goes ark at things you can't see. Or kar
or rit or something.'

Have you seen one lay eggs?' said Ford, suspiciously.

For heaven's sake of course I have,' said Arthur. And
I've eaten hundreds of them. Make rather a good omelette.
The secret is little cubes of cold butter and then whipping it
lightly with...'

I don't want a zarking recipe,' said Ford. I just want to
be sure it's a real bird and not some kind of multi-dimensional
cybernightmare.'

He slowly stood up from his crouched position and started
to brush himself down. He was still watching the bird, though.

So,' said Old Thrashbarg to Arthur. Is it written that Bob
shall once more take back unto himself the benediction of his
once-given sandwich maker?'

Ford almost went back into his crouch.

It's all right,' muttered Arthur, he always talks like that.'
Aloud, he said, Ah, venerable Thrashbarg. Um, yes. I'm afraid
I think I'm going to have to be popping off now. But young
Drimple, my apprentice, will be a fine sandwich maker in my
stead. He has the aptitude, a deep love of sandwiches, and the
skills he has acquired so far, though rudimentary as yet, will, in
time mature and, er, well, I think he'll work out OK is what I'm
trying to say.'

Old Thrashbarg regarded him gravely. His old grey eyes
moved sadly. He held his arms aloft, one still carrying a bobbing
pikka bird, the other his staff.

O Sandwich Maker from Bob!' he pronounced. He paused,
furrowed his brow, and sighed as he closed his eyes in pious
contemplation. Life,' he said, will be a very great deal less
weird without you!'

Arthur was stunned.

Do you know,' he said, I think that's the nicest thing any-
body's ever said to me?'

Can we get on, please?' said Ford.

Something was already happening. The presence of the pikka
bird at the end of Thrashbarg's outstretched arm was sending
tremors of interest through the thundering herd. The odd head
flicked momentarily in their direction. Arthur began to remem-
ber some of the Perfectly Normal Beast hunts he had witnessed.
He recalled that as well as the hunter-matadors brandishing their
capes there were always others standing behind them holding
pikka birds. He had always assumed that, like him, they had
just come along to watch.

Old Thrashbarg moved forward, a little closer to the rolling
herd. Some of the Beasts were now tossing their heads back
with interest at the sight of the pikka bird.

Old Thrashbarg's outstretched arms were trembling.

Only the pikka bird itself seemed to show no interest in
what was going on. A few anonymous molecules of air nowhere
in particular engaged all of its perky attention.

Now!' exclaimed Old Thrashbarg at last. Now you may
work them with the towel!'

Arthur advanced with Ford's towel, moving the way the
hunter-matadors did, with a kind of elegant strut that did not
come at all naturally to him. But now he knew what to do and
that it was right. He brandished and flicked the towel a few
times, to be ready for the moment, and then he watched.

Some distance away he spotted the Beast he wanted. Head
down, it was galloping towards him, right on the very edge of
the herd. Old Thrashbarg switched the bird, the Beast looked
up, tossed its head, and then, just as its head was coming down
again, Arthur flourished the towel in the Beast's line of sight. It
tossed its head again in bemusement, and its eyes followed the
movement of the towel.

He had got the Beast's attention.

From that moment on, it seemed the most natural thing
to coax and draw the animal towards him. Its head was up,
cocked slightly to one side. It was slowing to a canter and
then a trot. A few seconds later the huge thing was standing
there amongst them, snorting, panting, sweating, and sniffing
excitedly at the pikka bird, which appeared not to have noticed
its arrival at all. With strange sort of sweeping movements of his
arms Old Thrashbarg kept the pikka bird in front of the Beast,
but always out of its reach and always downwards. With strange
sort of sweeping movements of the towel, Arthur kept drawing
the Beast's attention this way and that - always downwards.

I don't think I've ever seen anything quite so stupid in
my life,' muttered Ford to himself.

At last, the Beast dropped, bemused but docile, to its knees.

Go!' whispered Old Thrashbarg urgently, to Ford. Go! Go
now!'

Ford leapt up on to the great creature's back, scrabbling
amongst its thick knotty fur for purchase, grasping great handfuls
of the stuff to hold him steady once he was in position.

Now, Sandwich Maker! Go!' He performed some elaborate
sign and ritual handshake which Arthur couldn't quite get the
hang of because Old Thrashbarg had obviously made it up
on the spur of the moment, then he pushed Arthur forward.
Taking a deep breath, he clambered up behind Ford on to
the great, hot, heaving back of the beast and held on tight.
Huge muscles the size of sea lions rippled and flexed beneath
him.

Old Thrashbarg held the bird suddenly aloft. The Beast's
head swivelled up to follow it. Thrashbarg pushed upwards
and upwards repeatedly with his arms and with the pikka bird;
and slowly, heavily the Perfectly Normal Beast lurched up off
its knees and stood, at last, swaying slightly. Its two riders held
on fiercely and nervously.

Arthur gazed out over the sea of hurtling animals, straining
in an attempt to see where it was they were going, but there
was nothing but heat haze.

Can you see anything?' he said to Ford.

No.' Ford twisted round to glance back, trying to see if
there was any clue as to where they had come from. Still,
nothing.

Arthur shouted down at Thrashbarg.

Do you know where they come from?' he called. Or where
they're going?'

The domain of the King!' shouted Old Thrashbarg back.

King?' shouted Arthur in surprise. What King?' The Per-
fectly Normal Beast was swaying and rocking restlessly under
him.

What do you mean, what King?' shouted Old Thrashbarg.
The King.'

It's just that you never mentioned a King,' shouted Arthur
back, in some consternation.

What?' shouted Old Thrashbarg. The thrumming of a thou-
sand hooves was very hard to hear over, and the old man was
concentrating on what he was doing.

Still holding the bird aloft, he led the Beast slowly round till
it was once more parallel with the motion of its great herd. He
moved forward. The Beast followed. He moved forward again.
The Beast followed again. At last, the Beast was lumbering for-
ward with a little momentum.

I said you never mentioned a King!' shouted Arthur again.

I didn't say a King,' shouted Old Thrashbarg, I said the King.'

He drew back his arm and then hurled it forward with all his
strength, casting the pikka bird up into the air above the herd.
This seemed to catch the pikka bird completely by surprise as it
had obviously not been paying any attention at all to what was
going on. It took it a moment or two to work out what was
happening, then it unfurled its little wings, spread them out,
and flew.

Go!' shouted Thrashbarg. Go and meet your destiny, Sand-
wich Maker!'

Arthur wasn't so sure about wanting to meet his destiny
as such. He just wanted to get to wherever it was they were
going so he could get back off this creature again. He didn't
feel at all safe up there. The Beast was gathering speed as it
followed in the wake of the pikka bird. And then it was in at
the fringes of the great tide of animals, and in a moment or two,
with its head down, the pikka bird forgotten, it was running with
the herd again and rapidly approaching the point at which the
herd was vanishing into thin air. Arthur and Ford held on to the
great monster for dear life, surrounded on all sides by hurtling
mountains of bodies.

Go! Ride that Beast!' shouted Thrashbarg. His distant voice
reverberated faintly in their ears. Ride that Perfectly Normal
Beast! Ride it, ride it!'

Ford shouted in Arthur's ear, Where did he say we were
going?'

He said something about a King,' shouted Arthur in return,
holding on desperately.

What King?'

That's what I said. He just said the King.'

I didn't know there was a the King,' shouted Ford.

Nor did I,' shouted Arthur back.

Except of course for the King,' shouted Ford. And I don't
suppose he meant him.'

What King?' shouted Arthur.

The point of exit was almost upon them. Just ahead of
them, Perfectly Normal Beasts were galloping into nothingness
and vanishing.

What do you mean, what King?' shouted Ford. I don't
know what King. I'm only saying that he couldn't possibly
mean the King, so I don't know what he means.'

Ford, I don't know what you're talking about.'

So?' said Ford. Then with a sudden rush, the stars came
on, turned and twisted around their heads, and then, just as
suddenly, turned off again.

Misty grey buildings loomed and flickered. They bounced up
and down in a highly embarrassing way.

What sort of buildings were they?

What were they for? What did they remind her of?

It's so difficult to know what things are supposed to be when
you suddenly turn up unexpectedly on a different world which has
a different culture, a different set of the most basic assumptions
about life, and also incredibly dull and meaningless architecture.

The sky above the buildings was a cold and hostile black.
The stars, which should have been blindingly brilliant points
of light this far from the sun were blurred and dulled by the
thickness of the huge shielding bubble. Perspex or something
like it. Something dull and heavy anyway.

Tricia wound the tape back again to the beginning.

She knew there was something slightly odd about it.

Well, in fact, there were about a million things that were
slightly odd about it, but there was one that was nagging at
her and she hadn't quite got it.

She sighed and yawned.

As she waited for the tape to rewind she cleared away some
of the dirty polystyrene coffee cups that had accumulated on the
editing desk and tipped them into the bin.

She was sitting in a small editing suite at a video production
company in Soho. She had Do not disturb' notices plastered all
over the door, and a block on all incoming calls at the switch-
board. This was originally to protect her astonishing scoop, but
now it was to protect her from embarrassment.

She would watch the tape all the way through again from
the beginning. If she could bear to. She might do some fast
forwarding here and there.

It was about four o'clock on Monday afternoon, and she
had a kind of sick feeling. She was trying to work out what the
cause of this slightly sick feeling was, and there was no shortage
of candidates.

First of all, it had all come on top of the overnight flight
from New York. The red eye. Always a killer, that.

Then, being accosted by aliens on her lawn and flown to
the planet Rupert. She was not sufficiently experienced in that
sort of thing to be able to say for sure that that was always a
killer, but she would be prepared to bet that those who went
through it regularly cursed it. There were always stress charts
being published in magazines. Fifty stress points for losing your
job. Seventy-five points for a divorce or changing your hairstyle
and so on. None of them ever mentioned being accosted on your
lawn by aliens and then being flown to the planet Rupert, but she
was sure it was worth a few dozen points.

It wasn't that the journey had been particularly stressful. It
had been extremely dull in fact. Certainly it had been no more
stressful than the trip she had just taken across the Atlantic and
it had taken roughly the same time, about seven hours.

Well that was pretty astounding wasn't it? Flying to the outer
limits of the solar system in the same time that it took to fly to
New York meant they must have some fantastic unheard-of form
of propulsion in the ship. She quizzed her hosts about it and they
agreed that it was pretty good.

But how does it work?' she had demanded excitedly. She
was still quite excited at the beginning of the trip.

She found that part of the tape and played it through to
herself. The Grebulons, which is what they called themselves,
were politely showing her which buttons they pressed to make
the ship go.

Yes, but what principle does it work on?' she heard herself
demand, from behind the camera.

Oh, you mean is it something like a warp drive or something
like that?' they said.

Yes,' persisted Tricia. What is it?'

It probably is something of the kind,' they said.

Like what?'

Warp drive, photon drive, something like that. You'd have
to ask the Flight Engineer.'

Which one is he?'

We don't know. We have all lost our minds, you see.'

Oh yes,' said Tricia, a little faintly. So you said. Um,
how did you lose your minds, exactly , then?.'

We don't know,' they said, patiently.

Because you've lost your minds,' echoed Tricia, glumly.

Would you like to watch television? It is a long flight.
We watch television. It is something we enjoy.'

All of this riveting stuff was on the tape, and fine. viewing
it made. First of all the picture quality was extremely poor.
Tricia didn't know why this was, exactly. She had a feeling
that the Grebulons responded to a slightly different range of
light frequencies, and that there had been a lot of ultra-violet
around which was mucking up the video camera. There were
a lot of interference patterns and video snow as well. Probably
something to do with the warp drive that none of them knew
the first thing about.

So what she had on tape, essentially, was a bunch of slightly
thin and discoloured people sitting around watching televisions
that were showing network broadcasts. She had also pointed the
camera out of the very tiny viewport near her seat and got a nice,
slightly streaky effect of stars. She knew it was real, but it would
have taken a good three or four minutes to fake.

In the end she had decided to save her precious videotape
for Rupert itself and had simply sat back and watched television
with them. She had even dozed off for a while.

So part of her sick feeling came from the sense that she
had had all that time in an alien spacecraft of astounding
technological design, and had spent most of it dozing in front of
reruns of M*A*S*H and Cagney and Lacey. But what else was
there to do? She had taken some photos as well, of course, all
of which had subsequently turned out to be badly fogged when
she got them back from the chemist.

Another part of her sick feeling probably came from the landing
on Rupert. This at least had been dramatic and hair-raising. The
ship had come sweeping in over a dark and sombre landscape, a
terrain so desperately far removed from the heat and light of its
parent sun that it seemed like a map of the psychological scars
on the mind of an abandoned child.

Lights blazed through the frozen darkness and guided the
ship into the mouth of some kind of cave that seemed to bend
itself open to accept the small craft.

Unfortunately, because of the angle of their approach, and
the depth at which the small thick viewport was set into the
craft's skin, it hadn't been possible to get the. video camera to
point directly at any of it. She ran through that bit of the tape.

The camera was pointing directly at the sun.

This is normally very bad for a video camera. But when
the sun is roughly a third of a billion miles away it doesn't
do any harm. In fact it hardly makes any impression at all.
You just get a small point of light right in the middle of the
frame, which could be just about anything. It was just one star
in a multitude.

Tricia fast-forwarded.

Ah. Now, the next bit had been quite promising. They had
emerged out of the ship into a vast, grey, hangar-like structure.
This was clearly alien technology on a dramatic scale. Huge grey
buildings under the dark canopy of the Perspex bubble. These
were the same buildings that she had been looking at at the end
of the tape. She had taken more footage of them while leaving
Rupert a few hours later, just as she was about to reboard the
spacecraft for the journey home. What did they remind her of?

Well, as much as anything else they reminded her of a
film set from just about any low-budget science-fiction movie of
the last twenty years. A lot larger, of course, but it all looked
thoroughly tawdry and unconvincing on the video screen. Apart
from the dreadful picture quality she had been struggling with the
unexpected effects of gravity that was appreciably lower than that
on Earth, and she had found it very hard to keep the camera from
bouncing around in an embarrassingly unprofessional way. It was
therefore impossible to make out any detail.

And now here was the Leader coming forward to greet
her, smiling and sticking his hand out.

That was all he was called. The Leader.

None of the Grebulons had names, largely because they
couldn't think of any. Tricia discovered that some of them had
thought of calling themselves after characters from television
programmes they had picked up from Earth, but hard as they
had tried to call each other Wayne and Bobby and Chuck, some
remnant of something lurking deep in the cultural subconscious
they had brought with them from the distant stars which were
their homes must have told them that this really wasn't right and
wouldn't do.

The Leader had looked pretty much like all the others.
Possibly a bit less thin. He said how much he enjoyed her shows
on TV, that he was her greatest fan, how glad he was that she
had been able to come along and visit them on Rupert and how
much everybody had been looking forward to her coming, how
he hoped the flight had been comfortable and so on. There was
no particular sense she could detect of being any kind of emissary
from the stars or anything.

Certainly, watching it now on videotape, he just looked like
some guy in costume and make-up, standing in front of a set
that wouldn't hold up too well if you leant against it.

She sat staring at the screen with her face cradled in her
hands, and shaking her head in slow bewilderment.

This was awful.

Not only was this bit awful but she knew what was coming
next. It was the bit where the Leader asked if she was hungry
after the flight, and would she perhaps like to come and have
something to eat? They could discuss things over a little dinner.

She could remember what she was thinking at this point.

Alien food.

How was she going to deal with it?

Would she actually have to eat it? Would she have access to
some sort of paper napkin she could spit stuff out into? Wouldn't
there be all sorts of differential immunity problems?

It turned out to be hamburgers.

Not only did it turn out to be hamburgers, but the hamburgers
it turned out to be were very clearly and obviously McDonald's
hamburgers which had been reheated in a microwave. It wasn't
just the look of them. It wasn't just the smell. It was the poly-
styrene clamshell packages they came in which had McDonald's'
printed all over them.

Eat! Enjoy!' said the Leader. Nothing is too good for our
honoured guest!'

This was in his private apartment. Tricia had looked around it
in bewilderment that had bordered on fear but had nevertheless
got it all on videotape.

The apartment had a waterbed in it. And a Midi hi-fi. And
one of those tall electrically illuminated glass things which sit on
table tops and appear to have large globules of sperm floating
about in them. The walls were covered in velvet.

The leader lounged against a brown corduroy bean bag and
squirted breath-freshener into his mouth.

Tricia began to feel very scared, suddenly. She was further from
Earth than any human being, to her knowledge, had ever been,
and she was with an alien creature, who was lounging against a
brown corduroy bean bag and squirting breath-freshener into his
mouth.

She didn't want to make any false moves. She didn't want
to alarm him. But there were things she had to know.

How did you... where did you get... this?' she asked,
gesturing around the room, nervously.

The decor?' asked the Leader. Do you like it? It is very
sophisticated. We are a sophisticated people, we Grebulons.
We buy sophisticated consumer durables... by mail order.'

Tricia had nodded tremendously slowly at this point.

Mail order...' she had said.

The Leader chuckled. It was one of those dark chocolate
reassuring silky chuckles.

I think you think they ship it here. No! Ha Ha! We have
arranged a special box number in New Hampshire. We make
regular pick-up visits. Ha Ha!' He lounged back in a relaxed
fashion on his bean bag, reached for a reheated french fry
and nibbled the end of it, an amused smile playing across. his
lips.

Tricia could feel her brain beginning to bubble very slightly.
She kept the video camera going.

How do you, well, er, how do you pay for these wonderful
...things?'

The Leader chuckled again.

American Express,' he said with a nonchalant shrug.

Tricia nodded slowly again. She knew that they gave cards
exclusively to just about anybody.

And these?' she said, holding up the hamburger he had
presented her with.

It is very easy,' said the Leader. We stand in line.'

Again, Tricia realised with a cold, trickling feeling going
down her spine, that explained an awful lot.She hit the fast forward button again. There was nothing of any
use here at all. It was all nightmarish madness. She could have
faked something that would have looked more convincing.

Another sick feeling began to creep over her as she watched
this hopeless awful tape, and she began, with slow horror, to
realise that it must be the answer.

She must be...

She shook her head and tried to get a grip.

An overnight flight going East... The sleeping pills she
had taken to get her through it. The vodka she'd had to set
the sleeping pills going.

What else? Well. There was seventeen years of obsession that
a glamorous man with two heads, one of which was disguised as
a parrot in a cage, had tried to pick her up at a party but had
then impatiently flown off to another planet in a flying saucer.
There suddenly seemed to be all sorts of bothersome aspects to
that idea that had never really occurred to her. Never occurred
to her. In seventeen years.

She stuffed her fist into her mouth.

She must get help.

Then there had been Eric Bartlett banging on about alien
spacecraft landing on her lawn. And before that... New York
had been, well, very hot and stressful. The high hopes and the
bitter disappointment. The astrology stuff.

She must have had a nervous breakdown.

That was it. She was exhausted and she had had a nervous
breakdown and had started hallucinating some time after she got
home. She had dreamt the whole story. An alien race of people
dispossessed of their own lives and histories, stuck on a remote
outpost of our solar system and filling their cultural vacuum with
our cultural junk. Ha! It was nature's way of telling her to check
into an expensive medical establishment very quickly.

She was very, very sick. She looked at how many large
coffees she'd got through as well, and realised how heavily
she was breathing and how fast.

Part of solving any problem, she told herself, was realising that
you had it. She started to bring her breathing under control. She
had caught herself in time. She had seen where she was. She was
on the way back from whatever psychological precipice she had
been on the brink of. She started to calm down, to calm down,
to calm down. She sat back in the chair and closed her eyes.

After a while, now that she was breathing normally again,
she opened them again.

So where had she got this tape from then?

It was still running.

All right. It was a fake.

She had faked it herself, that was it.

It must have been her who had faked it because her voice
was all over the soundtrack, asking questions. Every now and
then the camera would swing down at the end of a shot and she
would see her own feet in her own shoes. She had faked it and
she had no recollection of faking it or any idea of why she had
done it.

Her breathing was getting hectic again as she watched the
snowy, flickering screen.

She must still be hallucinating.

She shook her head, trying to make it go away. She had no
memory of faking any of this very obviously fake stuff. On the
other hand she did seem to have memories that were very like
the faked stuff. She continued to watch in a bewildered trance.

The person she imagined to be called the Leader was ques-
tioning her about astrology and she was answering smoothly and
calmly. Only she could detect the well-disguised rising panic in
her own voice.

The Leader pushed a button, and a maroon velvet wall
slid aside, revealing a large bank of flat TV monitors.

Each of the monitors was showing a kaleidoscope of different
images: a few seconds from a game show, a few seconds from a
cop show, a few seconds from a supermarket warehouse security
system, a few seconds from somebody's holiday movies, a few
seconds of sex, a few seconds of news, a few seconds of comedy.
It was clear that the Leader was very proud of all this stuff and
he was waving his hands like a conductor while continuing at the
same time to talk complete gibberish.

Another wave of his hands, and all the screens cleared to
form one giant computer screen showing in diagrammatic form
all the planets of the solar system and mapped out against a
background of the stars in their constellations. The display was
completely static.

We have great skills,' the Leader was saying. Great skills in
computation, in cosmological trigonometry, in three-dimensional
navigational calculus. Great skills. Great, great skills. Only we
have lost them. It is too bad. We like to have skills only they
have gone. They are in space somewhere, hurtling. With our
names and the details of our homes and loved ones. Please,' he
said, gesturing her forward to sit at the computer's console, be
skilful for us.'

Obviously what happened next was that Tricia quickly set
the video camera up on its tripod to capture the whole scene.
She then walked into shot herself and sat down calmly in front
of the giant computer display, spent a few moments familiarising
herself with the interface and then started smoothly and com-
petently to pretend that she had the faintest idea what she was
doing.

It hadn't been that difficult, in fact.

She was, after all, a mathematician and astrophysicist by
training and a television presenter by experience, and what
science she had forgotten over the years she was more than
capable of making up by bluffing.

The computer she was working on was clear evidence that
the Grebulons came from a far more advanced and sophisticated
culture than their current vacuous state suggested, and with its
aid she was able, within about half an hour, to cobble together
a rough working model of the solar system.

It wasn't particularly accurate or anything, but it looked
good. The planets were whizzing around in reasonably good
simulations of their orbits, and you could watch the movement
of the whole piece of virtual cosmological clockwork from any
point within the system - very roughly. You could watch from
Earth, you could watch from Mars, etc. You could watch from
the surface of the planet Rupert. Tricia had been quite impressed
with herself, but also very impressed with the computer system
she was working on. Using a computer workstation on Earth the
task would probably have taken a year or so of programming.

When she was finished, the Leader came up behind her and
watched. He was very pleased and delighted with what she had
achieved.

Good,' he said. And now, please, I would like you to
demonstrate how to use the system you have just designed
to translate the information in this book for me.'

Quietly he put a book down in front of her.

It was You and Your Planets by Gail Andrews.Tricia stopped the tape again.

She was definitely feeling very wobbly indeed. The feeling
that she was hallucinating had now receded, but had not left
anything any easier or clearer in her head.

She pushed her seat back from the editing desk and wondered
what to do. Years ago she had left the field of astronomical
research because she knew, without any doubt whatsoever,
that she had met a being from another planet. At a par-
ty. And she had also known, without any doubt whatsoever,
that she would have made herself a laughing stock if she had
ever said so. But how could she study cosmology and not
say anything about the single most important thing she knew
about it? She had done the only thing she could do. She had
left.

Now she worked in television and the same thing had happened
again.

She had videotape, actual videotape of the most astounding
story in the history of, well anything: a forgotten outpost of an
alien civilisation marooned on the outermost planet of our own
solar system.

She had the story.

She had been there.

She had seen it.

She had the videotape for God's sake.

And if she ever showed it to anybody, she would be a
laughing stock.How could she prove any of this? It wasn't even worth thinking
about. The whole thing was a nightmare from virtually any angle
she cared to look at it from. Her head was beginning to throb.

She had some aspirin in her bag. She went out of the little
editing suite to the water dispenser down the corridor. She took
the aspirin and drank several cups of water.

The place seemed to be very quiet. Usually there were more
people bustling about the place, or at least some people bustling
around the place. She popped her head round the door of the
editing suite next to hers but there was no one there.

She had gone rather overboard keeping people out of her
own suite. DO NOT DISTURB,' the notice read. DO NOT
EVEN THINK OF ENTERING. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT
IS. GO AWAY. I'M BUSY!'

When she went back in she noticed that the message light
on her phone extension was winking, and wondered how long
it had been on.

Hello?' she said to the receptionist.

Oh, Miss McMillan, I'm so glad you called. Everybody's
been trying to reach you. Your TV company. They're desperate
to reach you. Can you call them?'

Why didn't you put them through?' said Tricia.

You said I wasn't to put anybody through for anything. You
said I was to deny that you were even here. I didn't know what
to do. I came up to give you a message, but...'

OK,' said Tricia, cursing herself. She phoned her office.

Tricia! Where the haemorrhaging fuck are you?'

At the editing...'

They said...'

I know. What's up?'

What's up? Only a bloody alien spaceship!'

What? Where?'

Regent's Park. Big silver job. Some girl with a bird. She
speaks English and throws rocks at people and wants someone
to repair her watch. Just get there.'Tricia stared at it.

It wasn't a Grebulon ship. Not that she was suddenly an
expert on extraterrestrial craft, but this was a sleek and beautiful
silver and white thing about the size of a large ocean-going yacht,
which is what it most resembled. Next to this, the structures of the
huge half-dismantled Grebulon ship looked like gun turrets on a
battleship. Gun turrets. That's what those blank grey buildings
had looked like. And what was odd about them was that by the
time she passed them again on her way to reboarding the small
Grebulon craft, they had moved. These things flitted briefly
through her head as she ran from the taxi to meet her camera
crew.

Where's the girl?' she shouted above the noise of helicopters
and police sirens.

There!' shouted the producer while the sound engineer hurried
to clip a radio mike to her. She says her mother and father came
from here in some parallel dimension or something like that, and
she's got her father's watch, and... I don't know. What can I
tell you? Busk it. Ask her what it feels like to be from outer
space.'

Thanks a lot, Ted,' muttered Tricia, checked that her mike
was securely clipped, gave the engineer some level, took a deep
breath, tossed her hair back and switched into her role of pro-
fessional reporter, on home ground, ready for anything.

At least, nearly anything.

She turned to look for the girl. That must be her, with
the wild hair and wild eyes. The girl turned towards her. And
stared.

Mother!' she screamed, and started to hurl rocks at Tricia.

Daylight exploded around them. Hot, heavy sun. A desert plain
stretched out ahead in a haze of heat. They thundered out into
it.

Jump!' shouted Ford Prefect.

What?' shouted Arthur Dent, holding on for dear life.

There was no reply.

What did you say?' shouted Arthur again, and then realised
that Ford Prefect was no longer there. He looked around in panic
and started to slip. Realising he couldn't hold on any longer he
pushed himself sideways as hard as he could and rolled into a
ball as he hit the ground, rolling, rolling away from the pounding
hooves.

What a day, he thought, as he started furiously coughing
dust up out of his lungs. He hadn't had a day as bad as this
since the Earth had been blown up. He staggered up to his
knees , and then up to his feet and started to run away. He
didn't know what from or what to, but running away seemed a
prudent move.

He ran straight into Ford Prefect who was standing there
surveying the scene.

Look,' said Ford. That is precisely what we need.'

Arthur coughed up some more dust, and wiped some other
dust out of his hair and eyes. He turned, panting, to look at
what Ford was looking at.

It didn't look much like the domain of a King, or the King,
or any kind of King. It looked quite inviting though.

First, the context. This was a desert world. The dusty earth
was packed hard and had neatly bruised every last bit of Arthur
that hadn't already been bruised by the festivities of the previous
night. Some way ahead of them were great cliffs that looked like
sandstone, eroded by the wind and what little rain presumably
fell in those parts into wild and fantastic shapes, which matched
the fantastic shapes of the giant cacti that sprouted here and there
from the arid, orange landscape.

For a moment Arthur dared to hope they had unexpectedly
arrived in Arizona or New Mexico or maybe South Dakota, but
there was plenty of evidence that this was not the case.

The Perfectly Normal Beasts, for a start, still thundering,
still pounding. They swept up in their tens of thousands from
the far horizon, disappeared completely for about half a mile,
then swept off, thundering and pounding to the distant horizon
opposite.

Then there were the spaceships parked in front of the Bar
and Grill. Ah. The Domain of the King Bar and Grill. Bit of an
anti-climax, thought Arthur to himself.

In fact only one of the spaceships was parked in front of
the Domain of the King Bar and Grill. The other three were in
a parking lot by the side of the Bar and Grill. It was the one in
front that caught the eye, though. Wonderful looking thing. Wild
fins all over it, far, far too much chrome all over the fins and most
of the actual bodywork painted in a shocking pink. It crouched
there like an immense brooding insect and looked as if it was at
any moment about to jump on something about a mile away.

The Domain of the King Bar and Grill was slap bang in
the middle of where the Perfectly Normal Beasts would be
charging if they didn't take a minor transdimensional diversion
on the way. It stood on its own, undisturbed. An ordinary Bar
and Grill. A truckstop diner. Somewhere in the middle of nowhere.
Quiet. The Domain of the King.

Gonna buy that spaceship,' said Ford quietly.

Buy it?' said Arthur. That's not like you. I thought you
usually pinched them.'

Sometimes you have to show a little respect,' said Ford.

Probably have to show a little cash as well,' said Arthur.
How the hell much is that thing worth?'

With a tiny movement, Ford brought his Dine-O-Charge
credit card up out of his pocket. Arthur noticed that the hand
holding it was trembling very slightly.

I'll teach them to make me the restaurant critic...' breathed
Ford.

What do you mean?' asked Arthur.

I'll show you,' said Ford with a nasty glint in his eye.

Let's go and run up a few expenses shall we?'Couple beers,' said Ford, and, I dunno, a couple bacon rolls,
whatever you got, oh and that pink thing outside.'

He flipped his card on the top of the bar and looked around
casually.

There was a kind of silence.

There hadn't been a lot of noise before, but there was defi-
nitely a kind of silence now. Even the distant thunder of the
Perfectly Normal Beasts carefully avoiding the Domain of the
King seemed suddenly a little muted.

Just rode into town,' said Ford as if nothing was odd about
that or about anything else. He was leaning against the bar at
an extravagantly relaxed angle.

There were about three other customers in the place, sitting
at tables, nursing beers. About three. Some people would say
there were exactly three, but it wasn't that kind of a place, not
the kind of a place that you felt like being that specific in. There
was some big guy setting up some stuff on the little stage as well.
Old drum kit. Couple guitars. Country and Western kind of stuff.

The barman was not moving very swiftly to get in Ford's
order. In fact he wasn't moving at all.

Not sure that the pink thing's for sale,' he said at last
in the kind of accent that went on for quite a long time.

Sure it is,' said Ford. How much you want?'

Well...'

Think of a number, I'll double it.'

T'ain't mine to sell,' said the barman.

So, whose?'

The barman nodded at the big guy setting up on the stage.
Big fat guy, moving slow, balding.

Ford nodded. He grinned.

OK,' he said. Get the beers, get the rolls. Keep the tab open.'Arthur sat at the bar and rested. He was used to not knowing
what was going on. He felt comfortable with it. The beer was
pretty good and made him a little sleepy which he didn't mind
at all. The bacon rolls were not bacon rolls. They were Perfectly
Normal Beast rolls. He exchanged a few professional roll-making
remarks with the barman and just let Ford get on with whatever
Ford wanted to do.

OK,' said Ford, returning to his stool. It's cool. We got
the pink thing.'

The barman was very surprised. He's selling it to you?'

He's giving it to us for free,' said Ford, taking a gnaw at his
roll. Hey, no, keep the tab open though. We have some items
to add to it. Good roll.'

He took a deep pull of beer.

Good beer,' he added. Good ship too,' he said, eying
the big pink and chrome insect-like thing, bits of which could
be seen through the windows of the bar. Good everything,
pretty much. You know, he said, sitting back, reflectively, it's
at times like this that you kind of wonder if it's worth worrying
about the fabric of space time and the causal integrity of the
multi-dimensional probability matrix and the potential collapse
of all wave forms in the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash and
all that sort of stuff that's been bugging me. Maybe I feel that
what the big guy says is right. Just let it all go. What does it
matter? Let it go.'

Which big guy?' said Arthur.

Ford just nodded towards the stage. The big guy was saying
one two' into the mike a couple of times. Couple other guys
were on the stage now. Drums. Guitar.

The barman, who had been silent for a moment or two,
said, You say he's letting you have his ship?'

Yeah,' said Ford. Let it all go is what he said. Take the
ship. Take it with my blessing. Be good to her. I will he good
to her.'

He took a pull at his beer again.

Like I was saying,' he went on. It's at times like this that
you kind of think, let it all go. But then you think of guys like
InfiniDim Enterprises and you think, they are not going to get
away with it. They are going to suffer. It is my sacred and holy
duty to see those guys suffer. Here, let me put something on the
tab for the singer. I asked for a special request and we agreed.
It's to go on the tab. OK?'

OK,' said the barman, cautiously. Then he shrugged. OK,
however you want to do it. How much?'

Ford named a figure. The barman fell over amongst the
bottles and glasses. Ford vaulted quickly over the bar to check
that he was all right and help him back up to his feet. He'd cut
his finger and his elbow a bit and was feeling a little woozy but
was otherwise fine. The big guy started to sing. The barman
hobbled off with Ford's credit card to get authorisation.

Is there stuff going on here that I don't know about?' said
Arthur to Ford.

Isn't there usually?' said Ford.

No need to be like that,' said Arthur. He began to wake up.
Shouldn't we be going?' he said suddenly. Will that ship get us
to Earth?'

Sure will,' said Ford.

That's where Random will be going!' said Arthur with a
start. We can follow her! But... er...'

Ford let Arthur get on with thinking things out for himself
while he got out his old edition of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to
the Galaxy.

But where are we on the probability axis thing?' said Arthur.
Will the Earth be there or not there? I spent so much time look-
ing for it. All I found was planets that were a bit like it or not
at all like it, though it was clearly the right place because of the
continents. The worst version was called NowWhat where I got
bitten by some wretched little animal. That's how they commu-
nicated, you know, by biting each other. Bloody painful. Then
half the time, of course, the Earth isn't even there because it's
been blown up by the bloody Vogons. How much sense am I
making?'

Ford didn't comment. He was listening to something. He
passed the Guide over to Arthur and pointed at the screen.
The active entry read Earth. Mostly harmless.'

You mean it's there!' said Arthur excitedly. The Earth
is there! That's where Random will be going! The bird was
showing her the Earth in the rainstorm!'

Ford motioned Arthur to shout a little less loudly. He was
listening.

Arthur was growing impatient. He'd heard bar singers sing
Love Me Tender' before. He was a bit surprised to hear it
here, right in the middle of wherever the hell this was, certainly
not Earth, but then things tended not to surprise him these days
as much as formerly. The singer was quite good, as bar singers
went, if you liked that sort of thing, but Arthur was getting fretful.

He glanced at his watch. This only served to remind. him that
he didn't have his watch any more. Random had it, or at least
the remains of it.

Don't you think we should be going?' he said, insistently.

Shhh!' said Ford. I paid to hear this song.' He seemed
to have tears in his eyes, which Arthur found a bit disturbing.
He'd never seen Ford moved by anything other than very, very
strong drink. Probably the dust. He waited, tapping his fingers
irritably, out of time with the music.

The song ended. The singer went on to do Heartbreak Hotel'.

Anyway,' Ford whispered, I've got to review the restaurant.'

What?'

I have to write a review.'

Write a review? Of this place?'

Filing the review validates the expenses claim. I've fixed it so
that it happens completely automatically and untraceably. This
bill is going to need some validation,' he added quietly, staring
into his beer with a nasty smirk.

For a couple of beers and a roll?'

And a tip for the singer.'

Why, how much did you tip him?'

Ford named a figure again.

I don't know how much that is,' said Arthur. What's it
worth in pounds sterling? What would it buy you?'

It would probably buy you, roughly... er...' Ford screwed
his eyes up as he did some calculations in his head. Switzerland,'
he said at last. He picked up his Hitch Hiker's Guide and started
to type.

Arthur nodded intelligently. There were times when he wished
he understood what on earth Ford was talking about, and other
times, like now, when he felt it was probably safer not even to
try. He looked over Ford's shoulder. This isn't going to take
long, is it?' he said.

Nah,' said Ford. Piece of piss. Just mention that the rolls
were quite good, the beer good and cold, local wildlife nicely
eccentric, the bar singer the best in the known universe, and
that's about it. Doesn't need much. Just a validation.'

He touched an area on the screen marked ENTER and
the message vanished into the Sub-Etha.

You thought the singer was pretty good then?'

Yeah,' said Ford. The barman was returning with a piece
of paper, which seemed to be trembling in his hand.

He pushed it over to Ford with a kind of nervous, reverential
twitch.

Funny thing,' said the barman. The system rejected it first
couple times. Can't say it surprised me.' Beads of sweat were
standing on his brow. Then suddenly it's, oh yeah, that's OK,
and the system... er, validates it. Just like that. You wanna
...sign it?'

Ford scanned the form quickly. He sucked his teeth. This
is going to hurt InfiniDim a lot,' he said, with an appearance
of concern. Oh well,' he added softly, screw 'em.'

He signed with a flourish and handed it back to the barman.

More money,' he said, than the Colonel made for him
in an entire career of doing crap movies and casino gigs. Just
for doing what he does best. Standing up and singing in a bar.
And he negotiated it himself. I think this is a good moment for
him. Tell him I said thanks and buy him a drink.' He tossed a
few coins on the bar. The barman pushed them away.

I don't think that's necessary,' he said, slightly hoarsely.

Tis to me,' said Ford. OK, we are outa here.'They stood out in the heat and the dust and looked at the big
pink and chrome thing with amazement and admiration. Or at
least, Ford looked at it with amazement and admiration.

Arthur just looked at it. You don't think it's a bit overdone,
do you?'

He said it again when they climbed inside it. The seats
and quite a lot of the controls were covered in fine fur skin
or suede. There was a big gold monogram on the main control
panel which just read EP'.

You know,' said Ford as he fired up the ship's engines, I
asked him if it was true that he had been abducted by aliens,
and you know what he said?'

Who?' said Arthur.

The King.'

Which King? Oh, we've had this conversation, haven't we?'

Never mind,' said Ford. For what it's worth, he said, no.
He went of his own accord.'

I'm still not sure who we're talking about,' said Arthur.
Ford shook his head. Look,' he said, there are some tapes
over in the compartment to your left. Why don't you choose
some music and put it on?'

OK,' said Arthur, and flipped through the cartons. Do
you like Elvis Presley?' he said.

Yeah I do as a matter of fact,' said Ford. Now. I hope this
machine can leap like it looks Like it can.' He engaged the main
drive.

Yeeehaah!' shouted Ford as they shot upwards at face-tearing
speed.

It could.

The news networks don't like this kind of thing. They regard it
as a waste. An incontrovertible spaceship arrives out of nowhere
in the middle of London and it is sensational news of the highest
magnitude. Another completely different one arrives three and
a half hours later and somehow it isn't.

ANOTHER SPACECRAFT!' said the headlines and news
stand billboards. THIS ONE'S PINK.' A couple of months later
they could have made a lot more of it. The third spacecraft, half
an hour after that, the little four berth Hrundi runabout, only
made it on to the local news.

Ford and Arthur had come screaming down out of the strato-
sphere and parked neatly on Portland Place. It was just after
six-thirty in the evening and there were spaces free. They min-
gled briefly with the crowd that gathered round to ogle, then said
loudly that if no one else was going to call the police they would,
and made good their escape.

Home...' said Arthur, a husky tone creeping into his
voice as he gazed, misty-eyed around him.

Oh don't get all maudlin on me,' snapped Ford. We have
to find your daughter and we have to find that bird thing.'

How?' said Arthur. This is a planet of five and a half
billion people, and...'

Yes,' said Ford. But only one of them has just arrived
from outer space in a large silver spaceship accompanied by a
mechanical bird. I suggest we just find a television and some-
thing to drink while we watch it. We need some serious room
service.'They checked into a large two-bedroomed suite at the Langham.
Mysteriously, Ford's Dine-O-Charge card, issued on a planet over
five thousand light years away, seemed to present the hotel's
computer with no problems.

Ford hit the phones straight away while Arthur attempted
to locate the television.

OK,' said Ford. I want to order up some margaritas please.
Couple of pitchers. Couple of Chef's Salads. And as much foie
gras as you've got. And also London Zoo.'

She's on the news!' shouted Arthur from the next room.

That's what I said,' said Ford into the phone. London
Zoo. Just charge it to the room.'

She's... Good God!' shouted Arthur. Do you know who
she's being interviewed by?'

Are you having difficulty understanding the English lan-
guage?' continued Ford. It's the zoo just up the road from
here. I don't care if it's closed this evening. I don't want
to buy a ticket, I just want to buy the zoo. I don't care
if you're busy. This is room service, I'm in a room and I
want some service. Got a piece of paper? OK. Here's what
I want you to do. All the animals that can be safely returned
to the wild, return them. Set up some good teams of people
to monitor their progress in the wild, see that they're doing
OK.'

It's Trillian!' shouted Arthur. Or is it... er... God, I can't
stand all this parallel universe stuff. It's so bloody confusing. It
seems to be a different Trillian. It's Tricia McMillan which is
what Trillian used to be called before... er... Why don't
you come and watch, see if you can figure it out?'

Just a second,' Ford shouted, and returned to his negotia-
tions with room service. Then we'll need some natural reserves
for the animals that can't hack it in the wild,' he said. Set up a
team to work out the best places to do that. We might need to
buy somewhere like Zaire and maybe some islands. Madagascar.
Baffin. Sumatra. Those kind of places. We'll need a wide variety
of habitats. Look, l don't see why you're seeing this as a problem.
Learn to delegate. Hire whoever you want. Get on to it. I think
you'll find my credit is good. And blue cheese dressing on the
salad. Thank you.'

He put the phone down and went through to Arthur, who
was sitting on the edge of his bed watching television.

I ordered us some foie gras,' said Ford.

What?' said Arthur, whose attention was entirely focused
on the television.

I said I ordered us some foie gras.'

Oh,' said Arthur, vaguely. Um, I always feel a hit bad
about foie gras. Bit cruel to the geese, isn't it?'

Fuck 'em,' said Ford, slumping on the bed. You can't care
about every damn thing.'

Well, that's all very well for you to say, but...'

Drop it!' said Ford. If you don't like it I'll have yours.
What's happening?'

Chaos!' said Arthur. Complete chaos! Random keeps on
screaming at Trillian, or Tricia or whoever it is, that she aban-
doned her and then demanding to go to a good night club. Tricia's
broken down in tears and says she's never even met Random
let alone given birth to her. Then she suddenly started howling
about someone called Rupert and said that he had lost his mind
or something. I didn't quite follow that bit, to be honest. Then
Random started throwing stuff and they've cut to a commercial
break while they try and sort it all out. Oh! They've just cut back
to the studio! Shut up and watch.'

A rather shaken anchorman appeared on the screen and
apologised to viewers for the disruption of the previous item.
He said he didn't have any very clear news to report, only that
the mysterious girl, who called herself Random Frequent Flyer
Dent had left the studio to, er, rest. Tricia McMillan would be,
he hoped, back tomorrow. Meanwhile, fresh reports of UFO
activity were coming in...

Ford leaped up off the bed, grabbed the nearest phone and
jabbed at a number.

Concierge? You want to own the hotel? It's yours if you
can find out for me in five minutes which clubs Tricia McMillan
belongs to. Just charge the whole thing to this room.'

Away in the inky depths of space invisible movements were
being made.

Invisible to any of the inhabitants of the strange and tem-
peramental Plural zone at the focus of which lay the infinitely
multitudinous possibilities of the planet called Earth, but not
inconsequential to them.

At the very edge of the solar system, hunkered down on a
green leatherette sofa, staring fretfully at a range of TV and
computer screens sat a very worried Grebulon leader. He was
fiddling with stuff. Fiddling with his book on astrology. Fiddling
with the console of his computer. Fiddling with the displays
being fed through to him constantly from all of the Grebulons'
monitoring devices, all of them focused on the planet Earth.

He was distressed. Their mission was to monitor. But to
monitor secretly. He was a bit fed up with his mission, to be
honest. He was fairly certain that his mission must have been
to do more than sit around watching TV for years on end. They
certainly had a lot of other equipment with them that must have
had some purpose if only they hadn't accidentally lost all trace
of their purpose. He needed a sense of purpose in life, which
was why he had turned to astrology to fill the yawning gulf that
existed in the middle of his mind and soul. That would tell him
something, surely.

Well, it was telling him something.

It was telling him, as far as he could make out, that he
was about to have a very bad month, that things were going to
go from bad to worse if he didn't get a grip on things and start
making some positive moves and thinking things out for himself.

It was true. It was very clear from his star chart which
he had worked out using his astrology book and the computer
program which that nice Tricia McMillan had designed for him to
re-triangulate all the appropriate astronomical data. Earth-based
astrology had to be entirely recalculated to yield results that were
meaningful to the Grebulons here on the tenth planet out on the
frozen edges of the solar system.

The recalculations showed absolutely clearly and unamhigu-
ously that he was going to have a very bad month indeed,
starting with today. Because today Earth was starting to rise
into Capricorn, and that, for the Grebulon leader, who showed
all the character signs of being a classic Taurus, was very bad
indeed.

Now was the time, his horoscope said, for taking positive
actions, making tough decisions, seeing what needed to be done
and doing it. This was all very difficult for him, but he knew that
nobody ever said that doing tough stuff wasn't tough. The com-
puter was already tracking and predicting the second-by-second
location of the planet Earth. He ordered the great grey turrets
to swivel.Because all of the Grebulon surveillance equipment was focused
on the planet Earth, it failed to spot that there was now another
source of data in the solar system.

Its chances of spotting this other source of data - a massive
yellow constructor ship - accidentally were practically nil. It was
as far from the sun as Rupert was, but almost diametrically
opposite, almost hidden by the sun.

Almost.

The massive yellow constructor ship wanted to be able to
monitor events on Planet Ten without being spotted itself. It
had managed this very successfully.

There were all sorts of other ways in which this ship was
diametrically opposite to the Grebulons.

Its leader, its Captain, had a very clear idea of what his
purpose was. It was a very simple and plain one and he had been
pursuing it in his simple, plain way for a considerable period of
time now.

Anyone who knew of his purpose might have said that it was
a pointless and ugly one, that it wasn't the sort of purpose that
enhanced a life, put a spring in a person's step, made birds sing
and flowers bloom. Rather the reverse in fact. Absolutely the
reverse.

It wasn't his job to worry about that, though. It was his job
to do his job, which was to do his job. If that led to a certain
narrowness of vision and circularity of thought then it wasn't his
job to worry about such things. Any such things that came his
way were referred to others who had, in turn, other people to
refer such things to.

Many, many light years from here, indeed from anywhere,
lies the grim and long abandoned planet, Vogsphere. Some-
where on a fetid, fog-bound mud bank on this planet there
stands, surrounded by the dirty, broken and empty carapaces
of the last few jeweled scuttling crabs, a small stone monument
which marks the place, where it is thought, the species Vogon
Vogonblurtus first arose. On the monument there is carved an
arrow which points away into the fog, under which are inscribed
in plain, simple letters the words The buck stops there.'

Deep in the bowels of his unsightly yellow ship, the Vogon
Captain grunted as he reached for a slightly faded and dog-eared
piece of paper that lay in front of him. A demolition order.

If you were to unravel exactly where the Captain's job, which
was to do his job which was to do his job, actually began, then it
all came down at last to this piece of paper that had been issued
to him by his immediate superior long ago. The piece of paper
had an instruction on it, and his purpose was to carry out that
instruction and put a little tick mark in the adjacent box when
he had carried it out.

He had carried out the instruction once before, but a number
of troublesome circumstances had prevented him from being able
to put the tick in the little box.

One of the troublesome circumstances was the Plural nature of
this Galactic sector, where the possible continually interfered with
the probable. Simple demolition didn't get you any further than
pushing down a bubble under a badly hung strip of wallpaper.
Anything you demolished kept on popping up again. That would
soon be taken care of.

Another was a small bunch of people who continually refused
to be where they were supposed to be when they were supposed
to be there. That, also, would soon be taken care of.

The third was an irritating and anarchic little device called
the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. That was now well and
truly taken care of and, in fact, through the phenomenal power
of temporal reverse engineering, it was now itself the agency
through which everything else would be taken care of. The
Captain had merely come to watch the final act of this drama.
He himself did not have to lift a finger.

Show me,' he said.

The shadowy shape of a bird spread its wings and rose
into the air near him. Darkness engulfed the bridge. Dim
lights danced briefly in the black eyes of the bird as, deep in
its instructional address space, bracket after bracket was final-
ly closing, if clauses were finally ending, repeat loops halting,
recursive functions calling themselves for the last few times.

A brilliant vision lit up in the darkness, a watery blue and
green vision, a tube flowing through the air, shaped like a
chopped up string of sausages.

With a flatulent noise of satisfaction, the Vogon Captain
sat back to watch.

Just there, number forty-two,' shouted Ford Prefect to the
taxi-driver. Right here!'

The taxi lurched to a halt, and Ford and Arthur jumped out.
They had stopped at quite a number of cash-dispensers on the
way, and Ford chucked a fistful of money through the window
at the driver.

The entrance to the club was dark, smart and severe. Only
the smallest little plaque bore its name. Members knew where
it was, and if you weren't a member then knowing where it was
wasn't any help to you.

Ford Prefect was not a member of Stavro's though he had
once been to Stavro's other club in New York. He had a very
simple method of dealing with establishments of which he was not
a member. He simply swept in as soon as the door was opened,
pointed back at Arthur and said, It's OK, he's with me.'
 He bounded down the dark glossy stairs, feeling very froody
in his new shoes. They were suede and they were blue, and he
was very pleased that in spite of everything else going on he had
been sharp-eyed enough to spot them in a shop window from the
back of a speeding taxi.

I thought I told you not to come here.'

What?' said Ford.

A thin, ill-looking man wearing something baggy and Italian
was walking up the stairs past them, lighting a cigarette, and had
stopped, suddenly.

Not you,' he said. Him.'

He looked straight at Arthur, then seemed to become a
little confused.

Excuse me,' he said. I think I must have mistaken you
for someone else.' He started on up the stairs again , but almost
immediately turned round once more, even more puzzled. He
stared at Arthur.

Now what?' said Ford.

What did you say?'

I said, now what?' repeated Ford irritably.

Yes, I think so,' said the man and swayed slightly and
dropped the book of matches he'd been carrying. His mouth
moved weakly. Then he put his hand to his forehead.

Excuse me,' he said, I'm trying desperately to remember
which drug I've just taken, but it must be one of those ones
which mean you can't remember.'

He shook his head and turned away again, and went up
towards the men's room.

Come on,' said Ford. He hurried on downstairs, with Arthur
following nervously in his wake. The encounter had shaken him
badly and he didn't know why.

He didn't like places like this. For all of the dreams of Earth
and home he had had for years, he now badly missed his hut on
Lamuella with his knives and his sandwiches. He even missed
Old Thrashbarg.

Arthur!'

It was the most astounding effect. His name was being shouted
in stereo.

He twisted to look one way. Up the stairs behind him he saw
Trillian hurrying down towards him in her wonderfully rumpled
Rymplon TM. She was looking suddenly aghast.

He twisted the other way to see what she was looking suddenly
aghast at.

At the bottom of the stairs was Trillian, wearing... No
- this was Tricia. Tricia that he had just seen, hysterical with
confusion, on television. And behind her was Random, looking
more wild-eyed than ever. Behind her in the recesses of the
smart, dimly lit club, the other clientele of the evening formed a
frozen tableau, staring anxiously up at the confrontation on the
stairs.

For a few seconds everyone stood stock still. Only the music
from behind the bar didn't know to stop throbbing.

The gun she is holding,' said Ford quietly, nodding slightly
towards Random, is a Wabanatta . It was in the ship she stole
from me. It's quite dangerous in fact. Just don't move for a
moment. Let's just everybody stay calm and find out what's
upsetting her.'

Where do I fit?' screamed Random suddenly. The hand
holding the gun was trembling fiercely. Her other hand delved
into her pocket and pulled out the remains of Arthur's watch.
She shook it at them.

I thought I would fit here,' she cried, on the world that
made me! But it turns out that even my mother doesn't know
who I am!' She flung the watch violently aside, and it smashed
into the glasses behind the bar, scattering its innards.

Everyone was very quiet for a moment or two longer.

Random,' said Trillian quietly from up on the stairs.

Shut up!' shouted Random. You abandoned me!'

Random, it is very important that you listen to me and
understand,' persisted Trillian quietly. There isn't very much
time. We must leave. We must all leave.'

What are you talking about? We're always leaving!' She had
both hands on the gun now, and both were shaking. There was
no one in particular she was pointing it at. She was just pointing
it at the world in general.

Listen,' said Trillian again. I left you because I went to cover
a war for the network. It was extremely dangerous . At least, I
thought it was going to be. I arrived and the war had suddenly
ceased to happen. There was a time anomaly and... listen!
Please listen! A reconnaissance battleship had failed to turn up,
the rest of the fleet was scattered in some farcical disarray. It's
happening all the time now.'

I don't care! I don't want to hear about your bloody job!'
shouted Random. I want a home! I want to fit somewhere!'

This is not your home,' said Trillian, still keeping her voice
calm. You don't have one. We none of us have one. Hardly
anybody has one any more. The missing ship I was just talking
about. The people of that ship don't have a home. They don't
know where they are from. They don't even have any memory
of who they are or what they are for. They are very lost and
very confused and very frightened. They are here in this solar
system, and they are about to do something very... misguided
because they are so lost and confused. We... must... leave
... now. I can't tell you where there is to go to. Perhaps there
isn't anywhere. But here is not the place to be. Please. One more
time. Can we go?'

Random was wavering in panic and confusion.

It's all right,' said Arthur gently. If I'm here, we're safe.
Don't ask me to explain just now, but I am safe, so you are
safe. OK?'

What are you saying?' said Trillian.

Let's all just relax,' said Arthur. He was feeling very tranquil.
His life was charmed and none of this seemed real.

Slowly, gradually, Random began to relax, and to let the
gun down, inch by inch.

Two things happened simultaneously.

The door to the men's room at the top of the stairs opened,
and the man who had accosted Arthur came out, sniffing.

Startled at the sudden movement, Random lifted the gun
again just as a man standing behind her made a grab for it.

Arthur threw himself forward. There was a deafening explo-
sion. He fell awkwardly as Trillian threw herself down over him.
The noise died away. Arthur looked up to see the man at the top
of the stairs gazing down at him with a look of utter stupefaction.

You...' he said. Then slowly, horribly, he fell apart.

Random threw the gun down and fell to her knees, sobbing.
I'm sorry!' she said. I'm so sorry! I'm so, so sorry...'

Tricia went to her. Trillian went to her.

Arthur sat on the stairs with his head between his hands and
had not the faintest idea what to do. Ford was sitting on the stair
beneath him. He picked something up, looked at it with interest,
and passed it up to Arthur.

This mean anything to you? he said.

Arthur took it. It was the book of matches which the dead
man had dropped. It had the name of the club on it. It had the
name of the proprietor of the club on it. It looked like this:
He stared at it for some time as things began slowly to reassemble
themselves in his mind. He wondered what he should do, but
he only wondered it idly. Around him people were beginning
to rush and shout a lot, but it was suddenly very clear to him
that there was nothing to be done, not now or ever. Through
the new strangeness of noise and light he could just make out
the shape of Ford Prefect sitting back and laughing wildly.

A tremendous feeling of peace came over him. He knew
that at last, for once and for ever, it was now all, finally, over.
In the darkness of the bridge at the heart of the Vogon ship,
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz sat alone. Lights flared briefly across the
external vision screens that lined one wall. In the air above him
the discontinuities in the blue and green watery sausage shape
resolved themselves. Options collapsed, possibilities folded into
each other, and the whole at last resolved itself out of existence.

A very deep darkness descended. The Vogon captain sat
immersed in it for a few seconds.

Light' he said.

There was no response. The bird, too, had crumpled out
of all possibility.

The Vogon turned on the light himself. He picked up the
piece of paper again and placed a little tick in the little box.
Well, that was done. His ship slunk off into the inky void.In spite of having taken what he regarded as an extremely
positive piece of action, the Grebulon Leader ended up having
a very bad month after all. It was pretty much the same as all
the previous months except that there was now nothing on the
television any more. He put on a little light music instead.
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of
the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded
yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles
is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose ape-
descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still
think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.
This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most
of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.
Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these
were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces
of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small
green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and
most of them were miserable, even the ones with digital watches.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big
mistake in coming down from the trees in the first place. And
some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no
one should ever have left the oceans.
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man
had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be
nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a
small cafe in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that
had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the
world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was
right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to
anything.
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone-
about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe occurred, and the idea
was lost forever.
This is not her story.
But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some
of its consequences.
It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy - not an Earth book, never published on
Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or
heard of by any Earthman.
Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.
in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out
of the great publishing houses of Ursa Minor - of which no
Earthman had ever heard either.
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly
successful one - more popular than the Celestial Home Care
Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero
Gravity, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of
philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some More of
God's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?
In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern
Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's Guide has already supplanted
the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of
all knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and
contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate,
it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important
respects.
First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words
Don't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters on its cover.
But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its
extraordinary consequences, and the story of how these
consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable
book begins very simply.
It begins with a house.
The house stood on a slight rise just on the edge of the village.
It stood on its own and looked over a broad spread of West
Country farmland. Not a remarkable house by any means - it was
about thirty years old, squattish, squarish, made of brick, and
had four windows set in the front of a size and proportion which
more or less exactly failed to please the eye.
The only person for whom the house was in any way special was
Arthur Dent, and that was only because it happened to be the one
he lived in. He had lived in it for about three years, ever since
he had moved out of London because it made him nervous and
irritable. He was about thirty as well, dark haired and never-
quite at ease with himself. The thing that used to worry him most
was the fact that people always used to ask him what he was
looking so worried about. He worked in local radio which he
always used to tell his friends was a lot more interesting than
they probably thought. It was, too - most of his friends worked
in advertising.
It hadn't properly registered with Arthur that the council wanted
to knock down his house and build an bypass instead.
At eight o'clock on Thursday morning Arthur didn't feel very
good. He woke up blearily, got up, wandered blearily round his
room, opened a window, saw a bulldozer, found his slippers, and
stomped off to the bathroom to wash.
Toothpaste on the brush - so. Scrub.
Shaving mirror - pointing at the ceiling. He adjusted it. For a
moment it reflected a second bulldozer through the bathroom
window. Properly adjusted, it reflected Arthur Dent's bristles.
He shaved them off, washed, dried, and stomped off to the kitchen
to find something pleasant to put in his mouth.
Kettle, plug, fridge, milk, coffee. Yawn.
The word bulldozer wandered through his mind for a moment in
search of something to connect with.
The bulldozer outside the kitchen window was quite a big one.
He stared at it.
"Yellow," he thought and stomped off back to his bedroom to get
dressed.
Passing the bathroom he stopped to drink a large glass of water,
and another. He began to suspect that he was hung over. Why was
he hung over? Had he been drinking the night before? He supposed
that he must have been. He caught a glint in the shaving mirror.
"Yellow," he thought and stomped on to the bedroom.
He stood and thought. The pub, he thought. Oh dear, the pub. He
vaguely remembered being angry, angry about something that seemed
important. He'd been telling people about it, telling people
about it at great length, he rather suspected: his clearest
visual recollection was of glazed looks on other people's faces.
Something about a new bypass he had just found out about. It had
been in the pipeline for months only no one seemed to have known
about it. Ridiculous. He took a swig of water. It would sort
itself out, he'd decided, no one wanted a bypass, the council
didn't have a leg to stand on. It would sort itself out.
God what a terrible hangover it had earned him though. He looked
at himself in the wardrobe mirror. He stuck out his tongue.
"Yellow," he thought. The word yellow wandered through his mind
in search of something to connect with.
Fifteen seconds later he was out of the house and lying in front
of a big yellow bulldozer that was advancing up his garden path.
Mr L Prosser was, as they say, only human. In other words he was
a carbon-based life form descended from an ape. More specifically
he was forty, fat and shabby and worked for the local council.
Curiously enough, though he didn't know it, he was also a direct
male-line descendant of Genghis Khan, though intervening
generations and racial mixing had so juggled his genes that he
had no discernible Mongoloid characteristics, and the only
vestiges left in Mr L Prosser of his mighty ancestry were a
pronounced stoutness about the tum and a predilection for little
fur hats.
He was by no means a great warrior: in fact he was a nervous
worried man. Today he was particularly nervous and worried
because something had gone seriously wrong with his job - which
was to see that Arthur Dent's house got cleared out of the way
before the day was out.
"Come off it, Mr Dent,", he said, "you can't win you know. You
can't lie in front of the bulldozer indefinitely." He tried to
make his eyes blaze fiercely but they just wouldn't do it.
Arthur lay in the mud and squelched at him.
"I'm game," he said, "we'll see who rusts first."
"I'm afraid you're going to have to accept it," said Mr Prosser
gripping his fur hat and rolling it round the top of his head,
"this bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built!"
"First I've heard of it," said Arthur, "why's it going to be
built?"
Mr Prosser shook his finger at him for a bit, then stopped and
put it away again.
"What do you mean, why's it got to be built?" he said. "It's a
bypass. You've got to build bypasses."
Bypasses are devices which allow some people to drive from point
A to point B very fast whilst other people dash from point B to
point A very fast. People living at point C, being a point
directly in between, are often given to wonder what's so great
about point A that so many people of point B are so keen to get
there, and what's so great about point B that so many people of
point A are so keen to get there. They often wish that people
would just once and for all work out where the hell they wanted
to be.
Mr Prosser wanted to be at point D. Point D wasn't anywhere in
particular, it was just any convenient point a very long way from
points A, B and C. He would have a nice little cottage at point
D, with axes over the door, and spend a pleasant amount of time
at point E, which would be the nearest pub to point D. His wife
of course wanted climbing roses, but he wanted axes. He didn't
know why - he just liked axes. He flushed hotly under the
derisive grins of the bulldozer drivers.
He shifted his weight from foot to foot, but it was equally
uncomfortable on each. Obviously somebody had been appallingly
incompetent and he hoped to God it wasn't him.
Mr Prosser said: "You were quite entitled to make any suggestions
or protests at the appropriate time you know."
"Appropriate time?" hooted Arthur. "Appropriate time? The first I
knew about it was when a workman arrived at my home yesterday. I
asked him if he'd come to clean the windows and he said no he'd
come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me straight away of
course. Oh no. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me
a fiver. Then he told me."
"But Mr Dent, the plans have been available in the local planning
office for the last nine month."
"Oh yes, well as soon as I heard I went straight round to see
them, yesterday afternoon. You hadn't exactly gone out of your
way to call attention to them had you? I mean like actually
telling anybody or anything."
"But the plans were on display ..."
"On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find
them."
"That's the display department."
"With a torch."
"Ah, well the lights had probably gone."
"So had the stairs."
"But look, you found the notice didn't you?"
"Yes," said Arthur, "yes I did. It was on display in the bottom
of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a
sign on the door saying Beware of the Leopard."
A cloud passed overhead. It cast a shadow over Arthur Dent as he
lay propped up on his elbow in the cold mud. It cast a shadow
over Arthur Dent's house. Mr Prosser frowned at it.
"It's not as if it's a particularly nice house," he said.
"I'm sorry, but I happen to like it."
"You'll like the bypass."
"Oh shut up," said Arthur Dent. "Shut up and go away, and take
your bloody bypass with you. You haven't got a leg to stand on
and you know it."
Mr Prosser's mouth opened and closed a couple of times while his
mind was for a moment filled with inexplicable but terribly
attractive visions of Arthur Dent's house being consumed with
fire and Arthur himself running screaming from the blazing ruin
with at least three hefty spears protruding from his back. Mr
Prosser was often bothered with visions like these and they made
him feel very nervous. He stuttered for a moment and then pulled
himself together.
"Mr Dent," he said.
"Hello? Yes?" said Arthur.
"Some factual information for you. Have you any idea how much
damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight
over you?"
"How much?" said Arthur.
"None at all," said Mr Prosser, and stormed nervously off
wondering why his brain was filled with a thousand hairy horsemen
all shouting at him.
By a curious coincidence, None at all is exactly how much
suspicion the ape-descendant Arthur Dent had that one of his
closest friends was not descended from an ape, but was in fact
from a small planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from
Guildford as he usually claimed.
Arthur Dent had never, ever suspected this.
This friend of his had first arrived on the planet some fifteen
Earth years previously, and he had worked hard to blend himself
into Earth society - with, it must be said, some success. For
instance he had spent those fifteen years pretending to be an out
of work actor, which was plausible enough.
He had made one careless blunder though, because he had skimped a
bit on his preparatory research. The information he had gathered
had led him to choose the name "Ford Prefect" as being nicely
inconspicuous.
He was not conspicuously tall, his features were striking but not
conspicuously handsome. His hair was wiry and gingerish and
brushed backwards from the temples. His skin seemed to be pulled
backwards from the nose. There was something very slightly odd
about him, but it was difficult to say what it was. Perhaps it
was that his eyes didn't blink often enough and when you talked
to him for any length of time your eyes began involuntarily to
water on his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled slightly too
broadly and gave people the unnerving impression that he was
about to go for their neck.
He struck most of the friends he had made on Earth as an
eccentric, but a harmless one -- an unruly boozer with some
oddish habits. For instance he would often gatecrash university
parties, get badly drunk and start making fun of any
astrophysicist he could find till he got thrown out.
Sometimes he would get seized with oddly distracted moods and
stare into the sky as if hypnotized until someone asked him what
he was doing. Then he would start guiltily for a moment, relax
and grin.
"Oh, just looking for flying saucers," he would joke and everyone
would laugh and ask him what sort of flying saucers he was
looking for.
"Green ones!" he would reply with a wicked grin, laugh wildly for
a moment and then suddenly lunge for the nearest bar and buy an
enormous round of drinks.
Evenings like this usually ended badly. Ford would get out of his
skull on whisky, huddle into a corner with some girl and explain
to her in slurred phrases that honestly the colour of the flying
saucers didn't matter that much really.
Thereafter, staggering semi-paralytic down the night streets he
would often ask passing policemen if they knew the way to
Betelgeuse. The policemen would usually say something like,
"Don't you think it's about time you went off home sir?"
"I'm trying to baby, I'm trying to," is what Ford invariably
replied on these occasions.
In fact what he was really looking out for when he stared
distractedly into the night sky was any kind of flying saucer at
all. The reason he said green was that green was the traditional
space livery of the Betelgeuse trading scouts.
Ford Prefect was desperate that any flying saucer at all would
arrive soon because fifteen years was a long time to get stranded
anywhere, particularly somewhere as mindboggingly dull as the
Earth.
Ford wished that a flying saucer would arrive soon because he
knew how to flag flying saucers down and get lifts from them. He
knew how to see the Marvels of the Universe for less than thirty
Altairan dollars a day.
In fact, Ford Prefect was a roving researcher for that wholly
remarkable book The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
Human beings are great adaptors, and by lunchtime life in the
environs of Arthur's house had settled into a steady routine. It
was Arthur's accepted role to lie squelching in the mud making
occasional demands to see his lawyer, his mother or a good book;
it was Mr Prosser's accepted role to tackle Arthur with the
occasional new ploy such as the For the Public Good talk, the
March of Progress talk, the They Knocked My House Down Once You
Know, Never Looked Back talk and various other cajoleries and
threats; and it was the bulldozer drivers' accepted role to sit
around drinking coffee and experimenting with union regulations
to see how they could turn the situation to their financial
advantage.
The Earth moved slowly in its diurnal course.
The sun was beginning to dry out the mud Arthur lay in.
A shadow moved across him again.
"Hello Arthur," said the shadow.
Arthur looked up and squinting into the sun was startled to see
Ford Prefect standing above him.
"Ford! Hello, how are you?"
"Fine," said Ford, "look, are you busy?"
"Am I busy?" exclaimed Arthur. "Well, I've just got all these
bulldozers and things to lie in front of because they'll knock my
house down if I don't, but other than that ... well, no not
especially, why?"
They don't have sarcasm on Betelgeuse, and Ford Prefect often
failed to notice it unless he was concentrating. He said, "Good,
is there anywhere we can talk?"
"What?" said Arthur Dent.
For a few seconds Ford seemed to ignore him, and stared fixedly
into the sky like a rabbit trying to get run over by a car. Then
suddenly he squatted down beside Arthur.
"We've got to talk," he said urgently.
"Fine," said Arthur, "talk."
"And drink," said Ford. "It's vitally important that we talk and
drink. Now. We'll go to the pub in the village."
He looked into the sky again, nervous, expectant.
"Look, don't you understand?" shouted Arthur. He pointed at
Prosser. "That man wants to knock my house down!"
Ford glanced at him, puzzled.
"Well he can do it while you're away can't he?" he asked.
"But I don't want him to!"
"Ah."
"Look, what's the matter with you Ford?" said Arthur.
"Nothing. Nothing's the matter. Listen to me - I've got to tell
you the most important thing you've ever heard. I've got to tell
you now, and I've got to tell you in the saloon bar of the Horse
and Groom."
"But why?"
"Because you are going to need a very stiff drink."
Ford stared at Arthur, and Arthur was astonished to find that his
will was beginning to weaken. He didn't realize that this was
because of an old drinking game that Ford learned to play in the
hyperspace ports that served the madranite mining belts in the
star system of Orion Beta.
The game was not unlike the Earth game called Indian Wrestling,
and was played like this:
Two contestants would sit either side of a table, with a glass in
front of each of them.
Between them would be placed a bottle of Janx Spirit (as
immortalized in that ancient Orion mining song "Oh don't give me
none more of that Old Janx Spirit. No, don't you give me none
more of that Old Janx Spirit. For my head will fly, my tongue
will lie, my eyes will fry and I may die. Won't you pour me one
more of that sinful Old Janx Spirit".
Each of the two contestants would then concentrate their will on
the bottle and attempt to tip it and pour spirit into the glass
of his opponent - who would then have to drink it.
The bottle would then be refilled. The game would be played
again. And again.
Once you started to lose you would probably keep losing, because
one of the effects of Janx spirit is to depress telepsychic
power.
As soon as a predetermined quantity had been consumed, the final
loser would have to perform a forfeit, which was usually
obscenely biological.
Ford Prefect usually played to lose.
Ford stared at Arthur, who began to think that perhaps he did
want to go to the Horse and Groom after all.
"But what about my house ...?" he asked plaintively.
Ford looked across to Mr Prosser, and suddenly a wicked thought
struck him.
"He wants to knock your house down?"
"Yes, he wants to build ..."
"And he can't because you're lying in front of the bulldozers?"
"Yes, and ..."
"I'm sure we can come to some arrangement," said Ford. "Excuse
me!" he shouted.
Mr Prosser (who was arguing with a spokesman for the bulldozer
drivers about whether or not Arthur Dent constituted a mental
health hazard, and how much they should get paid if he did)
looked around. He was surprised and slightly alarmed to find that
Arthur had company.
"Yes? Hello?" he called. "Has Mr Dent come to his senses yet?"
"Can we for the moment," called Ford, "assume that he hasn't?"
"Well?" sighed Mr Prosser.
"And can we also assume," said Ford, "that he's going to be
staying here all day?"
"So?"
"So all your men are going to be standing around all day doing
nothing?"
"Could be, could be ..."
"Well, if you're resigned to doing that anyway, you don't
actually need him to lie here all the time do you?"
"What?"
"You don't," said Ford patiently, "actually need him here."
Mr Prosser thought about this.
"Well no, not as such...", he said, "not exactly need ..."
Prosser was worried. He thought that one of them wasn't making a
lot of sense.
Ford said, "So if you would just like to take it as read that
he's actually here, then he and I could slip off down to the pub
for half an hour. How does that sound?"
Mr Prosser thought it sounded perfectly potty.
"That sounds perfectly reasonable," he said in a reassuring tone
of voice, wondering who he was trying to reassure.
"And if you want to pop off for a quick one yourself later on,"
said Ford, "we can always cover up for you in return."
"Thank you very much," said Mr Prosser who no longer knew how to
play this at all, "thank you very much, yes, that's very kind
..." He frowned, then smiled, then tried to do both at once,
failed, grasped hold of his fur hat and rolled it fitfully round
the top of his head. He could only assume that he had just won.
"So," continued Ford Prefect, "if you would just like to come
over here and lie down ..."
"What?" said Mr Prosser.
"Ah, I'm sorry," said Ford, "perhaps I hadn't made myself fully
clear. Somebody's got to lie in front of the bulldozers haven't
they? Or there won't be anything to stop them driving into Mr
Dent's house will there?"
"What?" said Mr Prosser again.
"It's very simple," said Ford, "my client, Mr Dent, says that he
will stop lying here in the mud on the sole condition that you
come and take over from him."
"What are you talking about?" said Arthur, but Ford nudged him
with his shoe to be quiet.
"You want me," said Mr Prosser, spelling out this new thought to
himself, "to come and lie there ..."
"Yes."
"In front of the bulldozer?"
"Yes."
"Instead of Mr Dent."
"Yes."
"In the mud."
"In, as you say it, the mud."
As soon as Mr Prosser realized that he was substantially the
loser after all, it was as if a weight lifted itself off his
shoulders: this was more like the world as he knew it. He sighed.
"In return for which you will take Mr Dent with you down to the
pub?"
"That's it," said Ford. "That's it exactly."
Mr Prosser took a few nervous steps forward and stopped.
"Promise?"
"Promise," said Ford. He turned to Arthur.
"Come on," he said to him, "get up and let the man lie down."
Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream.
Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the
mud. He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he
sometimes wondered whose it was and whether they were enjoying
it. The mud folded itself round his bottom and his arms and oozed
into his shoes.
Ford looked at him severely.
"And no sneaky knocking down Mr Dent's house whilst he's away,
alright?" he said.
"The mere thought," growled Mr Prosser, "hadn't even begun to
speculate," he continued, settling himself back, "about the
merest possibility of crossing my mind."
He saw the bulldozer driver's union representative approaching
and let his head sink back and closed his eyes. He was trying to
marshal his arguments for proving that he did not now constitute
a mental health hazard himself. He was far from certain about
this - his mind seemed to be full of noise, horses, smoke, and
the stench of blood. This always happened when he felt miserable
and put upon, and he had never been able to explain it to
himself. In a high dimension of which we know nothing the mighty
Khan bellowed with rage, but Mr Prosser only trembled slightly
and whimpered. He began to fell little pricks of water behind the
eyelids. Bureaucratic cock-ups, angry men lying in the mud,
indecipherable strangers handing out inexplicable humiliations
and an unidentified army of horsemen laughing at him in his head
- what a day.
What a day. Ford Prefect knew that it didn't matter a pair of
dingo's kidneys whether Arthur's house got knocked down or not
now.
Arthur remained very worried.
"But can we trust him?" he said.
"Myself I'd trust him to the end of the Earth," said Ford.
"Oh yes," said Arthur, "and how far's that?"
"About twelve minutes away," said Ford, "come on, I need a
drink."
Here's what the Encyclopedia Galactica has to say about alcohol.
It says that alcohol is a colourless volatile liquid formed by
the fermentation of sugars and also notes its intoxicating effect
on certain carbon-based life forms.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy also mentions alcohol. It
says that the best drink in existence is the Pan Galactic Gargle
Blaster.
It says that the effect of a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster is like
having your brains smashed out by a slice of lemon wrapped round
a large gold brick.
The Guide also tells you on which planets the best Pan Galactic
Gargle Blasters are mixed, how much you can expect to pay for one
and what voluntary organizations exist to help you rehabilitate
afterwards.
The Guide even tells you how you can mix one yourself.
Take the juice from one bottle of that Ol' Janx Spirit, it says.
Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V
- Oh that Santraginean sea water, it says. Oh those Santraginean
fish!!!
Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture
(it must be properly iced or the benzine is lost).
Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in
memory of all those happy Hikers who have died of pleasure in the
Marshes of Fallia.
Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin
Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark
Qualactin Zones, subtle sweet and mystic.
Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve,
spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of
the drink.
Sprinkle Zamphuor.
Add an olive.
Drink ... but ... very carefully ...
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy sells rather better than
the Encyclopedia Galactica.
"Six pints of bitter," said Ford Prefect to the barman of the
Horse and Groom. "And quickly please, the world's about to end."
The barman of the Horse and Groom didn't deserve this sort of
treatment, he was a dignified old man. He pushed his glasses up
his nose and blinked at Ford Prefect. Ford ignored him and stared
out of the window, so the barman looked instead at Arthur who
shrugged helplessly and said nothing.
So the barman said, "Oh yes sir? Nice weather for it," and
started pulling pints.
He tried again.
"Going to watch the match this afternoon then?"
Ford glanced round at him.
"No, no point," he said, and looked back out of the window.
"What's that, foregone conclusion then you reckon sir?" said the
barman. "Arsenal without a chance?"
"No, no," said Ford, "it's just that the world's about to end."
"Oh yes sir, so you said," said the barman, looking over his
glasses this time at Arthur. "Lucky escape for Arsenal if it
did."
Ford looked back at him, genuinely surprised.
"No, not really," he said. He frowned.
The barman breathed in heavily. "There you are sir, six pints,"
he said.
Arthur smiled at him wanly and shrugged again. He turned and
smiled wanly at the rest of the pub just in case any of them had
heard what was going on.
None of them had, and none of them could understand what he was
smiling at them for.
A man sitting next to Ford at the bar looked at the two men,
looked at the six pints, did a swift burst of mental arithmetic,
arrived at an answer he liked and grinned a stupid hopeful grin
at them.
"Get off," said Ford, "They're ours," giving him a look that
would have an Algolian Suntiger get on with what it was doing.
Ford slapped a five-pound note on the bar. He said, "Keep the
change."
"What, from a fiver? Thank you sir."
"You've got ten minutes left to spend it."
The barman simply decided to walk away for a bit.
"Ford," said Arthur, "would you please tell me what the hell is
going on?"
"Drink up," said Ford, "you've got three pints to get through."
"Three pints?" said Arthur. "At lunchtime?"
The man next to ford grinned and nodded happily. Ford ignored
him. He said, "Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so."
"Very deep," said Arthur, "you should send that in to the
Reader's Digest. They've got a page for people like you."
"Drink up."
"Why three pints all of a sudden?"
"Muscle relaxant, you'll need it."
"Muscle relaxant?"
"Muscle relaxant."
Arthur stared into his beer.
"Did I do anything wrong today," he said, "or has the world
always been like this and I've been too wrapped up in myself to
notice?"
"Alright," said Ford, "I'll try to explain. How long have we
known each other?"
"How long?" Arthur thought. "Er, about five years, maybe six," he
said. "Most of it seemed to make some sense at the time."
"Alright," said Ford. "How would you react if I said that I'm not
from Guildford after all, but from a small planet somewhere in
the vicinity of Betelgeuse?"
Arthur shrugged in a so-so sort of way.
"I don't know," he said, taking a pull of beer. "Why - do you
think it's the sort of thing you're likely to say?"
Ford gave up. It really wasn't worth bothering at the moment,
what with the world being about to end. He just said:
"Drink up."
He added, perfectly factually:
"The world's about to end."
Arthur gave the rest of the pub another wan smile. The rest of
the pub frowned at him. A man waved at him to stop smiling at
them and mind his own business.
"This must be Thursday," said Arthur musing to himself, sinking
low over his beer, "I never could get the hang of Thursdays."
On this particular Thursday, something was moving quietly through
the ionosphere many miles above the surface of the planet;
several somethings in fact, several dozen huge yellow chunky
slablike somethings, huge as office buildings, silent as birds.
They soared with ease, basking in electromagnetic rays from the
star Sol, biding their time, grouping, preparing.
The planet beneath them was almost perfectly oblivious of their
presence, which was just how they wanted it for the moment. The
huge yellow somethings went unnoticed at Goonhilly, they passed
over Cape Canaveral without a blip, Woomera and Jodrell Bank
looked straight through them - which was a pity because it was
exactly the sort of thing they'd been looking for all these
years.
The only place they registered at all was on a small black device
called a Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic which winked away quietly to
itself. It nestled in the darkness inside a leather satchel which
Ford Prefect wore habitually round his neck. The contents of Ford
Prefect's satchel were quite interesting in fact and would have
made any Earth physicist's eyes pop out of his head, which is why
he always concealed them by keeping a couple of dog-eared scripts
for plays he pretended he was auditioning for stuffed in the top.
Besides the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic and the scripts he had an
Electronic Thumb - a short squat black rod, smooth and matt with
a couple of flat switches and dials at one end; he also had a
device which looked rather like a largish electronic calculator.
This had about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen
about four inches square on which any one of a million "pages"
could be summoned at a moment's notice. It looked insanely
complicated, and this was one of the reasons why the snug plastic
cover it fitted into had the words Don't Panic printed on it in
large friendly letters. The other reason was that this device was
in fact that most remarkable of all books ever to come out of the
great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor - The Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy. The reason why it was published in the form
of a micro sub meson electronic component is that if it were
printed in normal book form, an interstellar hitch hiker would
require several inconveniently large buildings to carry it around
in.
Beneath that in Ford Prefect's satchel were a few biros, a
notepad, and a largish bath towel from Marks and Spencer.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on
the subject of towels.
A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an
interstellar hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical
value - you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across
the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant
marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea
vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so
redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini
raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-
hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or
to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a
mindboggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it,
it can't see you - daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can
wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of
course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean
enough.
More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For
some reason, if a strag (strag: non-hitch hiker) discovers that a
hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume
that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel,
soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat
spray, wet weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the
strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a
dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have
"lost". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch
the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle
against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his
towel is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.
Hence a phrase which has passed into hitch hiking slang, as in
"Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There's a frood who
really knows where his towel is." (Sass: know, be aware of, meet,
have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really
amazingly together guy.)
Nestling quietly on top of the towel in Ford Prefect's satchel,
the Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic began to wink more quickly. Miles above
the surface of the planet the huge yellow somethings began to fan
out. At Jodrell Bank, someone decided it was time for a nice
relaxing cup of tea.
"You got a towel with you?" said Ford Prefect suddenly to Arthur.
Arthur, struggling through his third pint, looked round at him.
"Why? What, no ... should I have?" He had given up being
surprised, there didn't seem to be any point any longer.
Ford clicked his tongue in irritation.
"Drink up," he urged.
At that moment the dull sound of a rumbling crash from outside
filtered through the low murmur of the pub, through the sound of
the jukebox, through the sound of the man next to Ford hiccupping
over the whisky Ford had eventually bought him.
Arthur choked on his beer, leapt to his feet.
"What's that?" he yelped.
"Don't worry," said Ford, "they haven't started yet."
"Thank God for that," said Arthur and relaxed.
"It's probably just your house being knocked down," said Ford,
drowning his last pint.
"What?" shouted Arthur. Suddenly Ford's spell was broken. Arthur
looked wildly around him and ran to the window.
"My God they are! They're knocking my house down. What the hell
am I doing in the pub, Ford?"
"It hardly makes any difference at this stage," said Ford, "let
them have their fun."
"Fun?" yelped Arthur. "Fun!" He quickly checked out of the window
again that they were talking about the same thing.
"Damn their fun!" he hooted and ran out of the pub furiously
waving a nearly empty beer glass. He made no friends at all in
the pub that lunchtime.
"Stop, you vandals! You home wreckers!" bawled Arthur. "You half
crazed Visigoths, stop will you!"
Ford would have to go after him. Turning quickly to the barman he
asked for four packets of peanuts.
"There you are sir," said the barman, slapping the packets on the
bar, "twenty-eight pence if you'd be so kind."
Ford was very kind - he gave the barman another five-pound note
and told him to keep the change. The barman looked at it and then
looked at Ford. He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary
sensation that he didn't understand because no one on Earth had
ever experienced it before. In moments of great stress, every
life form that exists gives out a tiny sublimal signal. This
signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of
how far that being is from the place of his birth. On Earth it is
never possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from
your birthplace, which really isn't very far, so such signals are
too minute to be noticed. Ford Prefect was at this moment under
great stress, and he was born light years away in the near
vicinity of Betelgeuse.
The barman reeled for a moment, hit by a shocking,
incomprehensible sense of distance. He didn't know what it meant,
but he looked at Ford Prefect with a new sense of respect, almost
awe.
"Are you serious, sir?" he said in a small whisper which had the
effect of silencing the pub. "You think the world's going to
end?"
"Yes," said Ford.
"But, this afternoon?"
Ford had recovered himself. He was at his flippest.
"Yes," he said gaily, "in less than two minutes I would
estimate."
The barman couldn't believe the conversation he was having, but
he couldn't believe the sensation he had just had either.
"Isn't there anything we can do about it then?" he said.
"No, nothing," said Ford, stuffing the peanuts into his pockets.
Someone in the hushed bar suddenly laughed raucously at how
stupid everyone had become.
The man sitting next to Ford was a bit sozzled by now. His eyes
waved their way up to Ford.
"I thought," he said, "that if the world was going to end we were
meant to lie down or put a paper bag over our head or something."
"If you like, yes," said Ford.
"That's what they told us in the army," said the man, and his
eyes began the long trek back down to his whisky.
"Will that help?" asked the barman.
"No," said Ford and gave him a friendly smile. "Excuse me," he
said, "I've got to go." With a wave, he left.
The pub was silent for a moment longer, and then, embarrassingly
enough, the man with the raucous laugh did it again. The girl he
had dragged along to the pub with him had grown to loathe him
dearly over the last hour or so, and it would probably have been
a great satisfaction to her to know that in a minute and a half
or so he would suddenly evaporate into a whiff of hydrogen, ozone
and carbon monoxide. However, when the moment came she would be
too busy evaporating herself to notice it.
The barman cleared his throat. He heard himself say:
"Last orders, please."
The huge yellow machines began to sink downward and to move
faster.
Ford knew they were there. This wasn't the way he had wanted it.
Running up the lane, Arthur had nearly reached his house. He
didn't notice how cold it had suddenly become, he didn't notice
the wind, he didn't notice the sudden irrational squall of rain.
He didn't notice anything but the caterpillar bulldozers crawling
over the rubble that had been his home.
"You barbarians!" he yelled. "I'll sue the council for every
penny it's got! I'll have you hung, drawn and quartered! And
whipped! And boiled ... until ... until ... until you've had
enough."
Ford was running after him very fast. Very very fast.
"And then I'll do it again!" yelled Arthur. "And when I've
finished I will take all the little bits, and I will jump on
them!"
Arthur didn't notice that the men were running from the
bulldozers; he didn't notice that Mr Prosser was staring
hectically into the sky. What Mr Prosser had noticed was that
huge yellow somethings were screaming through the clouds.
Impossibly huge yellow somethings.
"And I will carry on jumping on them," yelled Arthur, still
running, "until I get blisters, or I can think of anything even
more unpleasant to do, and then ..."
Arthur tripped, and fell headlong, rolled and landed flat on his
back. At last he noticed that something was going on. His finger
shot upwards.
"What the hell's that?" he shrieked.
Whatever it was raced across the sky in monstrous yellowness,
tore the sky apart with mind-buggering noise and leapt off into
the distance leaving the gaping air to shut behind it with a bang
that drove your ears six feet into your skull.
Another one followed and did the same thing only louder.
It's difficult to say exactly what the people on the surface of
the planet were doing now, because they didn't really know what
they were doing themselves. None of it made a lot of sense -
running into houses, running out of houses, howling noiselessly
at the noise. All around the world city streets exploded with
people, cars slewed into each other as the noise fell on them and
then rolled off like a tidal wave over hills and valleys, deserts
and oceans, seeming to flatten everything it hit.
Only one man stood and watched the sky, stood with terrible
sadness in his eyes and rubber bungs in his ears. He knew exactly
what was happening and had known ever since his Sub-Etha Sens-O-
Matic had started winking in the dead of night beside his pillar
and woken him with a start. It was what he had waited for all
these years, but when he had deciphered the signal pattern
sitting alone in his small dark room a coldness had gripped him
and squeezed his heart. Of all the races in all of the Galaxy who
could have come and said a big hello to planet Earth, he thought,
didn't it just have to be the Vogons.
Still he knew what he had to do. As the Vogon craft screamed
through the air high above him he opened his satchel. He threw
away a copy of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, he
threw away a copy of Godspell: He wouldn't need them where he was
going. Everything was ready, everything was prepared.
He knew where his towel was.
A sudden silence hit the Earth. If anything it was worse than the
noise. For a while nothing happened.
The great ships hung motionless in the air, over every nation on
Earth. Motionless they hung, huge, heavy, steady in the sky, a
blasphemy against nature. Many people went straight into shock as
their minds tried to encompass what they were looking at. The
ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don't.
And still nothing happened.
Then there was a slight whisper, a sudden spacious whisper of
open ambient sound. Every hi fi set in the world, every radio,
every television, every cassette recorder, every woofer, every
tweeter, every mid-range driver in the world quietly turned
itself on.
Every tin can, every dust bin, every window, every car, every
wine glass, every sheet of rusty metal became activated as an
acoustically perfect sounding board.
Before the Earth passed away it was going to be treated to the
very ultimate in sound reproduction, the greatest public address
system ever built. But there was no concert, no music, no
fanfare, just a simple message.
"People of Earth, your attention please," a voice said, and it
was wonderful. Wonderful perfect quadrophonic sound with
distortion levels so low as to make a brave man weep.
"This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace
Planning Council," the voice continued. "As you will no doubt be
aware, the plans for development of the outlying regions of the
Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route
through your star system, and regrettably your planet is one of
those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly
less that two of your Earth minutes. Thank you."
The PA died away.
Uncomprehending terror settled on the watching people of Earth.
The terror moved slowly through the gathered crowds as if they
were iron fillings on a sheet of board and a magnet was moving
beneath them. Panic sprouted again, desperate fleeing panic, but
there was nowhere to flee to.
Observing this, the Vogons turned on their PA again. It said:
"There's no point in acting all surprised about it. All the
planning charts and demolition orders have been on display in
your local planning department on Alpha Centauri for fifty of
your Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge any
formal complaint and it's far too late to start making a fuss
about it now."
The PA fell silent again and its echo drifted off across the
land. The huge ships turned slowly in the sky with easy power. On
the underside of each a hatchway opened, an empty black space.
By this time somebody somewhere must have manned a radio
transmitter, located a wavelength and broadcasted a message back
to the Vogon ships, to plead on behalf of the planet. Nobody ever
heard what they said, they only heard the reply. The PA slammed
back into life again. The voice was annoyed. It said:
"What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? For
heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know.
I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in
local affairs that's your own lookout.
"Energize the demolition beams."
Light poured out into the hatchways.
"I don't know," said the voice on the PA, "apathetic bloody
planet, I've no sympathy at all." It cut off.
There was a terrible ghastly silence.
There was a terrible ghastly noise.
There was a terrible ghastly silence.
The Vogon Constructor fleet coasted away into the inky starry
void.
Far away on the opposite spiral arm of the Galaxy, five hundred
thousand light years from the star Sol, Zaphod Beeblebrox,
President of the Imperial Galactic Government, sped across the
seas of Damogran, his ion drive delta boat winking and flashing
in the Damogran sun.
Damogran the hot; Damogran the remote; Damogran the almost
totally unheard of.
Damogran, secret home of the Heart of Gold.
The boat sped on across the water. It would be some time before
it reached its destination because Damogran is such an
inconveniently arranged planet. It consists of nothing but
middling to large desert islands separated by very pretty but
annoyingly wide stretches of ocean.
The boat sped on.
Because of this topological awkwardness Damogran has always
remained a deserted planet. This is why the Imperial Galactic
Government chose Damogran for the Heart of Gold project, because
it was so deserted and the Heart of Gold was so secret.
The boat zipped and skipped across the sea, the sea that lay
between the main islands of the only archipelago of any useful
size on the whole planet. Zaphod Beeblebrox was on his way from
the tiny spaceport on Easter Island (the name was an entirely
meaningless coincidence - in Galacticspeke, easter means small
flat and light brown) to the Heart of Gold island, which by
another meaningless coincidence was called France.
One of the side effects of work on the Heart of Gold was a whole
string of pretty meaningless coincidences.
But it was not in any way a coincidence that today, the day of
culmination of the project, the great day of unveiling, the day
that the Heart of Gold was finally to be introduced to a
marvelling Galaxy, was also a great day of culmination for Zaphod
Beeblebrox. It was for the sake of this day that he had first
decided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent
waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy - Zaphod
Beeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox? Not the
President? Many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole
of known creation had finally gone bananas.
Zaphod grinned and gave the boat an extra kick of speed.
Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer, (crook?
quite possibly), manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personal
relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch.
President?
No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least.
Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on
which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod
Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was
more or less a fait accompli: he was the ideal Presidency
fodder*.
What they completely failed to understand was why Zaphod was
doing it.
He banked sharply, shooting a wild wall of water at the sun.
Today was the day; today was the day when they would realize what
Zaphod had been up to. Today was what Zaphod Beeblebrox's
Presidency was all about. Today was also his two hundredth
birthday, but that was just another meaningless coincidence.
As he skipped his boat across the seas of Damogran he smiled
quietly to himself about what a wonderful exciting day it was
going to be. He relaxed and spread his two arms lazily across the
seat back. He steered with an extra arm he'd recently fitted just
beneath his right one to help improve his ski-boxing.
"Hey," he cooed to himself, "you're a real cool boy you." But his
nerves sang a song shriller than a dog whistle.
The island of France was about twenty miles long, five miles
across the middle, sandy and crescent shaped. In fact it seemed
to exist not so much as an island in its own right as simply a
means of defining the sweep and curve of a huge bay. This
impression was heightened by the fact that the inner coastline of
the crescent consisted almost entirely of steep cliffs. From the
top of the cliff the land sloped slowly down five miles to the
opposite shore.
On top of the cliffs stood a reception committee.
It consisted in large part of the engineers and researchers who
had built the Heart of Gold - mostly humanoid, but here and there
were a few reptiloid atomineers, two or three green slyph-like
maximegalacticans, an octopoid physucturalist or two and a
Hooloovoo (a Hooloovoo is a super-intelligent shade of the color
blue). All except the Hooloovoo were resplendent in their multi-
colored ceremonial lab coats; the Hooloovoo had been temporarily
refracted into a free standing prism for the occasion.
There was a mood of immense excitement thrilling through all of
them. Together and between them they had gone to and beyond the
furthest limits of physical laws, restructured the fundamental
fabric of matter, strained, twisted and broken the laws of
possibility and impossibility, but still the greatest excitement
of all seemed to be to meet a man with an orange sash round his
neck. (An orange sash was what the President of the Galaxy
traditionally wore.) It might not even have made much difference
to them if they'd known exactly how much power the President of
the Galaxy actually wielded: none at all. Only six people in the
Galaxy knew that the job of the Galactic President was not to
wield power but to attract attention away from it.
Zaphod Beeblebrox was amazingly good at his job.
The crowd gasped, dazzled by sun and seemanship, as the
Presidential speedboat zipped round the headland into the bay. It
flashed and shone as it came skating over the sea in wide
skidding turns.
In fact it didn't need to touch the water at all, because it was
supported on a hazy cushion of ionized atoms - but just for
effect it was fitted with thin finblades which could be lowered
into the water. They slashed sheets of water hissing into the
air, carved deep gashes into the sea which swayed crazily and
sank back foaming into the boat's wake as it careered across the
bay.
Zaphod loved effect: it was what he was best at.
He twisted the wheel sharply, the boat slewed round in a wild
scything skid beneath the cliff face and dropped to rest lightly
on the rocking waves.
Within seconds he ran out onto the deck and waved and grinned at
over three billion people. The three billion people weren't
actually there, but they watched his every gesture through the
eyes of a small robot tri-D camera which hovered obsequiously in
the air nearby. The antics of the President always made amazingly
popular tri-D; that's what they were for.
He grinned again. Three billion and six people didn't know it,
but today would be a bigger antic than anyone had bargained for.
The robot camera homed in for a close up on the more popular of
his two heads and he waved again. He was roughly humanoid in
appearance except for the extra head and third arm. His fair
tousled hair stuck out in random directions, his blue eyes
glinted with something completely unidentifiable, and his chins
were almost always unshaven.
A twenty-foot-high transparent globe floated next to his boat,
rolling and bobbing, glistening in the brilliant sun. Inside it
floated a wide semi-circular sofa upholstered in glorious red
leather: the more the globe bobbed and rolled, the more the sofa
stayed perfectly still, steady as an upholstered rock. Again, all
done for effect as much as anything.
Zaphod stepped through the wall of the globe and relaxed on the
sofa. He spread his two arms lazily along the back and with the
third brushed some dust off his knee. His heads looked about,
smiling; he put his feet up. At any moment, he thought, he might
scream.
Water boiled up beneath the bubble, it seethed and spouted. The
bubble surged into the air, bobbing and rolling on the water
spout. Up, up it climbed, throwing stilts of light at the cliff.
Up it surged on the jet, the water falling from beneath it,
crashing back into the sea hundreds of feet below.
Zaphod smiled, picturing himself.
A thoroughly ridiculous form of transport, but a thoroughly
beautiful one.
At the top of the cliff the globe wavered for a moment, tipped on
to a railed ramp, rolled down it to a small concave platform and
riddled to a halt.
To tremendous applause Zaphod Beeblebrox stepped out of the
bubble, his orange sash blazing in the light.
The President of the Galaxy had arrived.
He waited for the applause to die down, then raised his hands in
greeting.
"Hi," he said.
A government spider sidled up to him and attempted to press a
copy of his prepared speech into his hands. Pages three to seven
of the original version were at the moment floating soggily on
the Damogran sea some five miles out from the bay. Pages one and
two had been salvaged by a Damogran Frond Crested Eagle and had
already become incorporated into an extraordinary new form of
nest which the eagle had invented. It was constructed largely of
papier m@ch@ and it was virtually impossible for a newly hatched
baby eagle to break out of it. The Damogran Frond Crested Eagle
had heard of the notion of survival of the species but wanted no
truck with it.
Zaphod Beeblebrox would not be needing his set speech and he
gently deflected the one being offered him by the spider.
"Hi," he said again.
Everyone beamed at him, or, at least, nearly everyone. He singled
out Trillian from the crowd. Trillian was a gird that Zaphod had
picked up recently whilst visiting a planet, just for fun,
incognito. She was slim, darkish, humanoid, with long waves of
black hair, a full mouth, an odd little nob of a nose and
ridiculously brown eyes. With her red head scarf knotted in that
particular way and her long flowing silky brown dress she looked
vaguely Arabic. Not that anyone there had ever heard of an Arab
of course. The Arabs had very recently ceased to exist, and even
when they had existed they were five hundred thousand light years
from Damogran. Trillian wasn't anybody in particular, or so
Zaphod claimed. She just went around with him rather a lot and
told him what she thought of him.
"Hi honey," he said to her.
She flashed him a quick tight smile and looked away. Then she
looked back for a moment and smiled more warmly - but by this
time he was looking at something else.
"Hi," he said to a small knot of creatures from the press who
were standing nearby wishing that he would stop saying Hi and get
on with the quotes. He grinned at them particularly because he
knew that in a few moments he would be giving them one hell of a
quote.
The next thing he said though was not a lot of use to them. One
of the officials of the party had irritably decided that the
President was clearly not in a mood to read the deliciously
turned speech that had been written for him, and had flipped the
switch on the remote control device in his pocket. Away in front
of them a huge white dome that bulged against the sky cracked
down in the middle, split, and slowly folded itself down into the
ground. Everyone gasped although they had known perfectly well it
was going to do that because they had built it that way.
Beneath it lay uncovered a huge starship, one hundred and fifty
metres long, shaped like a sleek running shoe, perfectly white
and mindboggingly beautiful. At the heart of it, unseen, lay a
small gold box which carried within it the most brain-wretching
device ever conceived, a device which made this starship unique
in the history of the galaxy, a device after which the ship had
been named - The Heart of Gold.
"Wow", said Zaphod Beeblebrox to the Heart of Gold. There wasn't
much else he could say.
He said it again because he knew it would annoy the press.
"Wow."
The crowd turned their faces back towards him expectantly. He
winked at Trillian who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes
at him. She knew what he was about to say and thought him a
terrible showoff.
"That is really amazing," he said. "That really is truly amazing.
That is so amazingly amazing I think I'd like to steal it."
A marvellous Presidential quote, absolutely true to form. The
crowd laughed appreciatively, the newsmen gleefully punched
buttons on their Sub-Etha News-Matics and the President grinned.
As he grinned his heart screamed unbearably and he fingered the
small Paralyso-Matic bomb that nestled quietly in his pocket.
Finally he could bear it no more. He lifted his heads up to the
sky, let out a wild whoop in major thirds, threw the bomb to the
ground and ran forward through the sea of suddenly frozen smiles.
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was not a pleasant sight, even for other
Vogons. His highly domed nose rose high above a small piggy
forehead. His dark green rubbery skin was thick enough for him to
play the game of Vogon Civil Service politics, and play it well,
and waterproof enough for him to survive indefinitely at sea
depths of up to a thousand feet with no ill effects.
Not that he ever went swimming of course. His busy schedule would
not allow it. He was the way he was because billions of years ago
when the Vogons had first crawled out of the sluggish primeval
seas of Vogsphere, and had lain panting and heaving on the
planet's virgin shores... when the first rays of the bright young
Vogsol sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the
forces of evolution ad simply given up on them there and then,
had turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and
unfortunate mistake. They never evolved again; they should never
have survived.
The fact that they did is some kind of tribute to the thick-
willed slug-brained stubbornness of these creatures. Evolution?
they said to themselves, Who needs it?, and what nature refused
to do for them they simply did without until such time as they
were able to rectify the grosser anatomical inconveniences with
surgery.
Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet Vogsphere had been
working overtime to make up for their earlier blunder. They
brought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs, which the
Vogons ate, smashing their shells with iron mallets; tall
aspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which the
Vogons cut down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazelle-
like creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the Vogons
would catch and sit on. They were no use as transport because
their backs would snap instantly, but the Vogons sat on them
anyway.
Thus the planet Vogsphere whiled away the unhappy millennia until
the Vogons suddenly discovered the principles of interstellar
travel. Within a few short Vog years every last Vogon had
migrated to the Megabrantis cluster, the political hub of the
Galaxy and now formed the immensely powerful backbone of the
Galactic Civil Service. They have attempted to acquire learning,
they have attempted to acquire style and social grace, but in
most respects the modern Vogon is little different from his
primitive forebears. Every year they import twenty-seven thousand
scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs from their native planet
and while away a happy drunken night smashing them to bits with
iron mallets.
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was a fairly typical Vogon in that he was
thoroughly vile. Also, he did not like hitch hikers.
Somewhere in a small dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz's flagship, a small match flared
nervously. The owner of the match was not a Vogon, but he knew
all about them and was right to be nervous. His name was Ford
Prefect*.
He looked about the cabin but could see very little; strange
monstrous shadows loomed and leaped with the tiny flickering
flame, but all was quiet. He breathed a silent thank you to the
Dentrassis. The Dentrassis are an unruly tribe of gourmands, a
wild but pleasant bunch whom the Vogons had recently taken to
employing as catering staff on their long haul fleets, on the
strict understanding that they keep themselves very much to
themselves.
This suited the Dentrassis fine, because they loved Vogon money,
which is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the
Vogons themselves. The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to
see was an annoyed Vogon.
It was because of this tiny piece of information that Ford
Prefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon
monoxide.
He heard a slight groan. By the light of the match he saw a heavy
shape moving slightly on the floor. Quickly he shook the match
out, reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and
took it out. He crouched on the floor. The shape moved again.
Ford Prefect said: "I bought some peanuts."
Arthur Dent moved, and groaned again, muttering incoherently.
"Here, have some," urged Ford, shaking the packet again, "if
you've never been through a matter transference beam before
you've probably lost some salt and protein. The beer you had
should have cushioned your system a bit."
"Whhhrrrr..." said Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes.
"It's dark," he said.
"Yes," said Ford Prefect, "it's dark."
"No light," said Arthur Dent. "Dark, no light."
One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to
understand about human beings was their habit of continually
stating and repeating the obvious, as in It's a nice day, or
You're very tall, or Oh dear you seem to have fallen down a
thirty-foot well, are you alright? At first Ford had formed a
theory to account for this strange behaviour. If human beings
don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths
probably seize up. After a few months' consideration and
observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If
they don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their
brains start working. After a while he abandoned this one as well
as being obstructively cynical and decided he quite liked human
beings after all, but he always remained desperately worried
about the terrible number of things they didn't know about.
"Yes," he agreed with Arthur, "no light." He helped Arthur to
some peanuts. "How do you feel?" he asked.
"Like a military academy," said Arthur, "bits of me keep on
passing out."
Ford stared at him blankly in the darkness.
"If I asked you where the hell we were," said Arthur weakly,
"would I regret it?"
Ford stood up. "We're safe," he said.
"Oh good," said Arthur.
"We're in a small galley cabin," said Ford, "in one of the
spaceships of the Vogon Constructor Fleet."
"Ah," said Arthur, "this is obviously some strange usage of the
word safe that I wasn't previously aware of."
Ford struck another match to help him search for a light switch.
Monstrous shadows leaped and loomed again. Arthur struggled to
his feet and hugged himself apprehensively. Hideous alien shapes
seemed to throng about him, the air was thick with musty smells
which sidled into his lungs without identifying themselves, and a
low irritating hum kept his brain from focusing.
"How did we get here?" he asked, shivering slightly.
"We hitched a lift," said Ford.
"Excuse me?" said Arthur. "Are you trying to tell me that we just
stuck out our thumbs and some green bug-eyed monster stuck his
head out and said, Hi fellas, hop right in. I can take you as far
as the Basingstoke roundabout?"
"Well," said Ford, "the Thumb's an electronic sub-etha signalling
device, the roundabout's at Barnard's Star six light years away,
but otherwise, that's more or less right."
"And the bug-eyed monster?"
"Is green, yes."
"Fine," said Arthur, "when can I get home?"
"You can't," said Ford Prefect, and found the light switch.
"Shade your eyes ..." he said, and turned it on.
Even Ford was surprised.
"Good grief," said Arthur, "is this really the interior of a
flying saucer?"
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz heaved his unpleasant green body round the
control bridge. He always felt vaguely irritable after
demolishing populated planets. He wished that someone would come
and tell him that it was all wrong so that he could shout at them
and feel better. He flopped as heavily as he could on to his
control seat in the hope that it would break and give him
something to be genuinely angry about, but it only gave a
complaining sort of creak.
"Go away!" he shouted at a young Vogon guard who entered the
bridge at that moment. The guard vanished immediately, feeling
rather relieved. He was glad it wouldn't now be him who delivered
the report they'd just received. The report was an official
release which said that a wonderful new form of spaceship drive
was at this moment being unveiled at a government research base
on Damogran which would henceforth make all hyperspatial express
routes unnecessary.
Another door slid open, but this time the Vogon captain didn't
shout because it was the door from the galley quarters where the
Dentrassis prepared his meals. A meal would be most welcome.
A huge furry creature bounded through the door with his lunch
tray. It was grinning like a maniac.
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was delighted. He knew that when a
Dentrassi looked that pleased with itself there was something
going on somewhere on the ship that he could get very angry
indeed about.
Ford and Arthur stared about them.
"Well, what do you think?" said Ford.
"It's a bit squalid, isn't it?"
Ford frowned at the grubby mattress, unwashed cups and
unidentifiable bits of smelly alien underwear that lay around the
cramped cabin.
"Well, this is a working ship, you see," said Ford. "These are
the Dentrassi sleeping quarters."
"I thought you said they were called Vogons or something."
"Yes," said Ford, "the Vogons run the ship, the Dentrassis are
the cooks, they let us on board."
"I'm confused," said Arthur.
"Here, have a look at this," said Ford. He sat down on one of the
mattresses and rummaged about in his satchel. Arthur prodded the
mattress nervously and then sat on it himself: in fact he had
very little to be nervous about, because all mattresses grown in
the swamps of Squornshellous Zeta are very thoroughly killed and
dried before being put to service. Very few have ever come to
life again.
Ford handed the book to Arthur.
"What is it?" asked Arthur.
"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. It's a sort of electronic
book. It tells you everything you need to know about anything.
That's its job."
Arthur turned it over nervously in his hands.
"I like the cover," he said. "Don't Panic. It's the first helpful
or intelligible thing anybody's said to me all day."
"I'll show you how it works," said Ford. He snatched it from
Arthur who was still holding it as if it was a two-week-dead lark
and pulled it out of its cover.
"You press this button here you see and the screen lights up
giving you the index."
A screen, about three inches by four, lit up and characters began
to flicker across the surface.
"You want to know about Vogons, so I enter that name so." His
fingers tapped some more keys. "And there we are."
The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the
screen.
Ford pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and
words began to undulate across it. At the same time, the book
began to speak the entry as well in a still quiet measured voice.
This is what the book said.
"Vogon Constructor Fleets. Here is what to do if you want to get
a lift from a Vogon: forget it. They are one of the most
unpleasant races in the Galaxy -- not actually evil, but bad
tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even
lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous
Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate,
sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public
inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat and recycled
as firelighters.
"The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your
finger down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to
feed his grandmother to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.
"On no account allow a Vogon to read poetry at you."
Arthur blinked at it.
"What a strange book. How did we get a lift then?"
"That's the point, it's out of date now," said Ford, sliding the
book back into its cover. "I'm doing the field research for the
New Revised Edition, and one of the things I'll have to include
is a bit about how the Vogons now employ Dentrassi cooks which
gives us a rather useful little loophole."
A pained expression crossed Arthur's face. "But who are the
Dentrassi?" he said.
"Great guys," said Ford. "They're the best cooks and the best
drink mixers and they don't give a wet slap about anything else.
And they'll always help hitch hikers aboard, partly because they
like the company, but mostly because it annoys the Vogons. Which
is exactly the sort of thing you need to know if you're an
impoverished hitch hiker trying to see the marvels of the
Universe for less than thirty Altairan Dollars a day. And that's
my job. Fun, isn't it?"
Arthur looked lost.
"It's amazing," he said and frowned at one of the other
mattresses.
"Unfortunately I got stuck on the Earth for rather longer than I
intended," said Ford. "I came for a week and got stuck for
fifteen years."
"But how did you get there in the first place then?"
"Easy, I got a lift with a teaser."
"A teaser?"
"Yeah."
"Er, what is ..."
"A teaser? Teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do. They
cruise around looking for planets which haven't made interstellar
contact yet and buzz them."
"Buzz them?" Arthur began to feel that Ford was enjoying making
life difficult for him.
"Yeah", said Ford, "they buzz them. They find some isolated spot
with very few people around, then land right by some poor soul
whom no one's ever going to believe and then strut up and down in
front of him wearing silly antennae on their heads and making
beep beep noises. Rather childish really." Ford leant back on the
mattress with his hands behind his head and looked infuriatingly
pleased with himself.
"Ford," insisted Arthur, "I don't know if this sounds like a
silly question, but what am I doing here?"
"Well you know that," said Ford. "I rescued you from the Earth."
"And what's happened to the Earth?"
"Ah. It's been demolished."
"Has it," said Arthur levelly.
"Yes. It just boiled away into space."
"Look," said Arthur, "I'm a bit upset about that."
Ford frowned to himself and seemed to roll the thought around his
mind.
"Yes, I can understand that," he said at last.
"Understand that!" shouted Arthur. "Understand that!"
Ford sprang up.
"Keep looking at the book!" he hissed urgently.
"What?"
"Don't Panic."
"I'm not panicking!"
"Yes you are."
"Alright so I'm panicking, what else is there to do?"
"You just come along with me and have a good time. The Galaxy's a
fun place. You'll need to have this fish in your ear."
"I beg your pardon?" asked Arthur, rather politely he thought.
Ford was holding up a small glass jar which quite clearly had a
small yellow fish wriggling around in it. Arthur blinked at him.
He wished there was something simple and recognizable he could
grasp hold of. He would have felt safe if alongside the Dentrassi
underwear, the piles of Squornshellous mattresses and the man
from Betelgeuse holding up a small yellow fish and offering to
put it in his ear he had been able to see just a small packet of
corn flakes. He couldn't, and he didn't feel safe.
Suddenly a violent noise leapt at them from no source that he
could identify. He gasped in terror at what sounded like a man
trying to gargle whilst fighting off a pack of wolves.
"Shush!" said Ford. "Listen, it might be important."
"Im ... important?"
"It's the Vogon captain making an announcement on the T'annoy."
"You mean that's how the Vogons talk?"
"Listen!"
"But I can't speak Vogon!"
"You don't need to. Just put that fish in your ear."
Ford, with a lightning movement, clapped his hand to Arthur's
ear, and he had the sudden sickening sensation of the fish
slithering deep into his aural tract. Gasping with horror he
scrabbled at his ear for a second or so, but then slowly turned
goggle-eyed with wonder. He was experiencing the aural equivalent
of looking at a picture of two black silhouetted faces and
suddenly seeing it as a picture of a white candlestick. Or of
looking at a lot of coloured dots on a piece of paper which
suddenly resolve themselves into the figure six and mean that
your optician is going to charge you a lot of money for a new
pair of glasses.
He was still listening to the howling gargles, he knew that, only
now it had taken on the semblance of perfectly straightforward
English.
This is what he heard ...
"Howl howl gargle howl gargle howl howl howl gargle howl gargle
howl howl gargle gargle howl gargle gargle gargle howl slurrp
uuuurgh should have a good time. Message repeats. This is your
captain speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay
attention. First of all I see from our instruments that we have a
couple of hitchhikers aboard. Hello wherever you are. I just want
to make it totally clear that you are not at all welcome. I
worked hard to get where I am today, and I didn't become captain
of a Vogon constructor ship simply so I could turn it into a taxi
service for a load of degenerate freeloaders. I have sent out a
search party, and as soon that they find you I will put you off
the ship. If you're very lucky I might read you some of my poetry
first.
"Secondly, we are about to jump into hyperspace for the journey
to Barnard's Star. On arrival we will stay in dock for a
seventy-two hour refit, and no one's to leave the ship during
that time. I repeat, all planet leave is cancelled. I've just had
an unhappy love affair, so I don't see why anybody else should
have a good time. Message ends."
The noise stopped.
Arthur discovered to his embarrassment that he was lying curled
up in a small ball on the floor with his arms wrapped round his
head. He smiled weakly.
"Charming man," he said. "I wish I had a daughter so I could
forbid her to marry one ..."
"You wouldn't need to," said Ford. "They've got as much sex
appeal as a road accident. No, don't move," he added as Arthur
began to uncurl himself, "you'd better be prepared for the jump
into hyperspace. It's unpleasantly like being drunk."
"What's so unpleasant about being drunk?"
"You ask a glass of water."
Arthur thought about this.
"Ford," he said.
"Yeah?"
"What's this fish doing in my ear?"
"It's translating for you. It's a Babel fish. Look it up in the
book if you like."
He tossed over The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and then
curled himself up into a foetal ball to prepare himself for the
jump.
At that moment the bottom fell out of Arthur's mind.
His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top
of his head.
The room folded flat about him, spun around, shifted out of
existence and left him sliding into his own navel.
They were passing through hyperspace.
"The Babel fish," said The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy
quietly, "is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the
oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy not
from its carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all
unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to
nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its
carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious
thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech
centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical
upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear
you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of
language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the
brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel
fish.
"Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything
so mindboggingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that
some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching
proof of the non-existence of God.
"The argument goes something like this: I refuse to prove that I
exist,' says God, for proof denies faith, and without faith I am
nothing.'
"But,' says Man, The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it?
It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so
therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.'
"Oh dear,' says God, I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly
vanished in a puff of logic.
"Oh, that was easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to
prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next
zebra crossing.
"Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of
dingo's kidneys, but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid making a
small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-
selling book Well That About Wraps It Up For God.
"Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all
barriers to communication between different races and cultures,
has caused more and bloddier wars than anything else in the
history of creation."
Arthur let out a low groan. He was horrified to discover that the
kick through hyperspace hadn't killed him. He was now six light
years from the place that the Earth would have been if it still
existed.
The Earth.
Visions of it swam sickeningly through his nauseated mind. There
was no way his imagination could feel the impact of the whole
Earth having gone, it was too big. He prodded his feelings by
thinking that his parents and his sister had gone. No reaction.
He thought of all the people he had been close to. No reaction.
Then he thought of a complete stranger he had been standing
behind in the queue at the supermarket before and felt a sudden
stab - the supermarket was gone, everything in it was gone.
Nelson's Column had gone! Nelson's Column had gone and there
would be no outcry, because there was no one left to make an
outcry. From now on Nelson's Column only existed in his mind.
England only existed in his mind - his mind, stuck here in this
dank smelly steel-lined spaceship. A wave of claustrophobia
closed in on him.
England no longer existed. He'd got that - somehow he'd got it.
He tried again. America, he thought, has gone. He couldn't grasp
it. He decided to start smaller again. New York has gone. No
reaction. He'd never seriously believed it existed anyway. The
dollar, he thought, had sunk for ever. Slight tremor there. Every
Bogart movie has been wiped, he said to himself, and that gave
him a nasty knock. McDonalds, he thought. There is no longer any
such thing as a McDonald's hamburger.
He passed out. When he came round a second later he found he was
sobbing for his mother.
He jerked himself violently to his feet.
"Ford!"
Ford looked up from where he was sitting in a corner humming to
himself. He always found the actual travelling-through-space part
of space travel rather trying.
"Yeah?" he said.
"If you're a researcher on this book thing and you were on Earth,
you must have been gathering material on it."
"Well, I was able to extend the original entry a bit, yes."
"Let me see what it says in this edition then, I've got to see
it."
"Yeah OK." He passed it over again.
Arthur grabbed hold of it and tried to stop his hands shaking. He
pressed the entry for the relevant page. The screen flashed and
swirled and resolved into a page of print. Arthur stared at it.
"It doesn't have an entry!" he burst out.
Ford looked over his shoulder.
"Yes it does," he said, "down there, see at the bottom of the
screen, just under Eccentrica Gallumbits, the triple-breasted
whore of Eroticon ."
Arthur followed Ford's finger, and saw where it was pointing. For
a moment it still didn't register, then his mind nearly blew up.
"What? Harmless? Is that all it's got to say? Harmless! One
word!"
Ford shrugged.
"Well, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy, and only
a limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors," he
said, "and no one knew much about the Earth of course."
"Well for God's sake I hope you managed to rectify that a bit."
"Oh yes, well I managed to transmit a new entry off to the
editor. He had to trim it a bit, but it's still an improvement."
"And what does it say now?" asked Arthur.
"Mostly harmless," admitted Ford with a slightly embarrassed
cough.
"Mostly harmless!" shouted Arthur.
"What was that noise?" hissed Ford.
"It was me shouting," shouted Arthur.
"No! Shut up!" said Ford. I think we're in trouble."
"You think we're in trouble!"
Outside the door were the sounds of marching feet.
"The Dentrassi?" whispered Arthur.
"No, those are steel tipped boots," said Ford.
There was a sharp ringing rap on the door.
"Then who is it?" said Arthur.
"Well," said Ford, "if we're lucky it's just the Vogons come to
throw us in to space."
"And if we're unlucky?"
"If we're unlucky," said Ford grimly, "the captain might be
serious in his threat that he's going to read us some of his
poetry first ..."
Vogon poetry is of course the third worst in the Universe.
The second worst is that of the Azagoths of Kria. During a
recitation by their Poet Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his
poem "Ode To A Small Lump of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One
Midsummer Morning" four of his audience died of internal
haemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-Galactic Arts
Nobbling Council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off.
Grunthos is reported to have been "disappointed" by the poem's
reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his twelve-
book epic entitled My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles when his own
major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save life and
civilization, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled
his brain.
The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator
Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex, England in
the destruction of the planet Earth.
Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz smiled very slowly. This was done not so
much for effect as because he was trying to remember the sequence
of muscle movements. He had had a terribly therapeutic yell at
his prisoners and was now feeling quite relaxed and ready for a
little callousness.
The prisoners sat in Poetry Appreciation Chairs --strapped in.
Vogons suffered no illusions as to the regard their works were
generally held in. Their early attempts at composition had been
part of bludgeoning insistence that they be accepted as a
properly evolved and cultured race, but now the only thing that
kept them going was sheer bloodymindedness.
The sweat stood out cold on Ford Prefect's brow, and slid round
the electrodes strapped to his temples. These were attached to a
battery of electronic equipment - imagery intensifiers, rhythmic
modulators, alliterative residulators and simile dumpers - all
designed to heighten the experience of the poem and make sure
that not a single nuance of the poet's thought was lost.
Arthur Dent sat and quivered. He had no idea what he was in for,
but he knew that he hadn't liked anything that had happened so
far and didn't think things were likely to change.
The Vogon began to read - a fetid little passage of his own
devising.
"Oh frettled gruntbuggly ..." he began. Spasms wracked Ford's
body - this was worse than ever he'd been prepared for.
"... thy micturations are to me | As plurdled gabbleblotchits on
a lurgid bee."
"Aaaaaaarggggghhhhhh!" went Ford Prefect, wrenching his head back
as lumps of pain thumped through it. He could dimly see beside
him Arthur lolling and rolling in his seat. He clenched his
teeth.
"Groop I implore thee," continued the merciless Vogon, "my
foonting turlingdromes."
His voice was rising to a horrible pitch of impassioned
stridency. "And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly
bindlewurdles,| Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my
blurglecruncheon, see if I don't!"
"Nnnnnnnnnnyyyyyyyuuuuuuurrrrrrrggggggghhhhh!" cried Ford Prefect
and threw one final spasm as the electronic enhancement of the
last line caught him full blast across the temples. He went limp.
Arthur lolled.
"Now Earthlings ..." whirred the Vogon (he didn't know that Ford
Prefect was in fact from a small planet in the vicinity of
Betelgeuse, and wouldn't have cared if he had) "I present you
with a simple choice! Either die in the vacuum of space, or ..."
he paused for melodramatic effect, "tell me how good you thought
my poem was!"
He threw himself backwards into a huge leathery bat-shaped seat
and watched them. He did the smile again.
Ford was rasping for breath. He rolled his dusty tongue round his
parched mouth and moaned.
Arthur said brightly: "Actually I quite liked it."
Ford turned and gaped. Here was an approach that had quite simply
not occurred to him.
The Vogon raised a surprised eyebrow that effectively obscured
his nose and was therefore no bad thing.
"Oh good ..." he whirred, in considerable astonishment.
"Oh yes," said Arthur, "I thought that some of the metaphysical
imagery was really particularly effective."
Ford continued to stare at him, slowly organizing his thoughts
around this totally new concept. Were they really going to be
able to bareface their way out of this?
"Yes, do continue ..." invited the Vogon.
"Oh ... and er ... interesting rhythmic devices too," continued
Arthur, "which seemed to counterpoint the ... er ... er ..." He
floundered.
Ford leaped to his rescue, hazarding "counterpoint the surrealism
of the underlying metaphor of the ... er ..." He floundered too,
but Arthur was ready again.
"... humanity of the ..."
"Vogonity," Ford hissed at him.
"Ah yes, Vogonity (sorry) of the poet's compassionate soul,"
Arthur felt he was on a home stretch now, "which contrives
through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate this,
transcend that, and come to terms with the fundamental
dichotomies of the other," (he was reaching a triumphant
crescendo ...) "and one is left with a profound and vivid insight
into ... into ... er ..." (... which suddenly gave out on him.)
Ford leaped in with the coup de gr@ce:
"Into whatever it was the poem was about!" he yelled. Out of the
corner of his mouth: "Well done, Arthur, that was very good."
The Vogon perused them. For a moment his embittered racial soul
had been touched, but he thought no - too little too late. His
voice took on the quality of a cat snagging brushed nylon.
"So what you're saying is that I write poetry because underneath
my mean callous heartless exterior I really just want to be
loved," he said. He paused. "Is that right?"
Ford laughed a nervous laugh. "Well I mean yes," he said, "don't
we all, deep down, you know ... er ..."
The Vogon stood up.
"No, well you're completely wrong," he said, "I just write poetry
to throw my mean callous heartless exterior into sharp relief.
I'm going to throw you off the ship anyway. Guard! Take the
prisoners to number three airlock and throw them out!"
"What?" shouted Ford.
A huge young Vogon guard stepped forward and yanked them out of
their straps with his huge blubbery arms.
"You can't throw us into space," yelled Ford, "we're trying to
write a book."
"Resistance is useless!" shouted the Vogon guard back at him. It
was the first phrase he'd learnt when he joined the Vogon Guard
Corps.
The captain watched with detached amusement and then turned away.
Arthur stared round him wildly.
"I don't want to die now!" he yelled. "I've still got a headache!
I don't want to go to heaven with a headache, I'd be all cross
and wouldn't enjoy it!"
The guard grasped them both firmly round the neck, and bowing
deferentially towards his captain's back, hoiked them both
protesting out of the bridge. A steel door closed and the captain
was on his own again. He hummed quietly and mused to himself,
lightly fingering his notebook of verses.
"Hmmmm," he said, "counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying
metaphor ..." He considered this for a moment, and then closed
the book with a grim smile.
"Death's too good for them," he said.
The long steel-lined corridor echoed to the feeble struggles of
the two humanoids clamped firmly under rubbery Vogon armpits.
"This is great," spluttered Arthur, "this is really terrific. Let
go of me you brute!"
The Vogon guard dragged them on.
"Don't you worry," said Ford, "I'll think of something." He
didn't sound hopeful.
"Resistance is useless!" bellowed the guard.
"Just don't say things like that," stammered Ford. "How can
anyone maintain a positive mental attitude if you're saying
things like that?"
"My God," complained Arthur, "you're talking about a positive
mental attitude and you haven't even had your planet demolished
today. I woke up this morning and thought I'd have a nice relaxed
day, do a bit of reading, brush the dog ... It's now just after
four in the afternoon and I'm already thrown out of an alien
spaceship six light years from the smoking remains of the Earth!"
He spluttered and gurgled as the Vogon tightened his grip.
"Alright," said Ford, "just stop panicking."
"Who said anything about panicking?" snapped Arthur. "This is
still just the culture shock. You wait till I've settled down
into the situation and found my bearings. Then I'll start
panicking."
"Arthur you're getting hysterical. Shut up!" Ford tried
desperately to think, but was interrupted by the guard shouting
again.
"Resistance is useless!"
"And you can shut up as well!" snapped Ford.
"Resistance is useless!"
"Oh give it a rest," said Ford. He twisted his head till he was
looking straight up into his captor's face. A thought struck him.
"Do you really enjoy this sort of thing?" he asked suddenly.
The Vogon stopped dead and a look of immense stupidity seeped
slowly over his face.
"Enjoy?" he boomed. "What do you mean?"
"What I mean," said Ford, "is does it give you a full satisfying
life? Stomping around, shouting, pushing people out of spaceships
..."
The Vogon stared up at the low steel ceiling and his eyebrows
almost rolled over each other. His mouth slacked. Finally he
said, "Well the hours are good ..."
"They'd have to be," agreed Ford.
Arthur twisted his head to look at Ford.
"Ford, what are you doing?" he asked in an amazed whisper.
"Oh, just trying to take an interest in the world around me, OK?"
he said. "So the hours are pretty good then?" he resumed.
The Vogon stared down at him as sluggish thoughts moiled around
in the murky depths.
"Yeah," he said, "but now you come to mention it, most of the
actual minutes are pretty lousy. Except ..." he thought again,
which required looking at the ceiling - "except some of the
shouting I quite like." He filled his lungs and bellowed,
"Resistance is ..."
"Sure, yes," interrupted Ford hurriedly, "you're good at that, I
can tell. But if it's mostly lousy," he said, slowly giving the
words time to reach their mark, "then why do you do it? What is
it? The girls? The leather? The machismo? Or do you just find
that coming to terms with the mindless tedium of it all presents
an interesting challenge?"
"Er ..." said the guard, "er ... er ... I dunno. I think I just
sort of ... do it really. My aunt said that spaceship guard was a
good career for a young Vogon - you know, the uniform, the low-
slung stun ray holster, the mindless tedium ..."
"There you are Arthur," said Ford with the air of someone
reaching the conclusion of his argument, "you think you've got
problems."
Arthur rather thought he had. Apart from the unpleasant business
with his home planet the Vogon guard had half-throttled him
already and he didn't like the sound of being thrown into space
very much.
"Try and understand his problem," insisted Ford. "Here he is poor
lad, his entire life's work is stamping around, throwing people
off spaceships ..."
"And shouting," added the guard.
"And shouting, sure," said Ford patting the blubbery arm clamped
round his neck in friendly condescension, "... and he doesn't
even know why he's doing it!"
Arthur agreed this was very sad. He did this with a small feeble
gesture, because he was too asphyxicated to speak.
Deep rumblings of bemusement came from the guard.
"Well. Now you put it like that I suppose ..."
"Good lad!" encouraged Ford.
"But alright," went on the rumblings, "so what's the
alternative?"
"Well," said Ford, brightly but slowly, "stop doing it of course!
Tell them," he went on, "you're not going to do it anymore." He
felt he had to add something to that, but for the moment the
guard seemed to have his mind occupied pondering that much.
"Eerrrrrrmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ..." said the guard, 
"erm, well that doesn't sound that great to me."
Ford suddenly felt the moment slipping away.
"Now wait a minute," he said, "that's just the start you see,
there's more to it than that you see ..."
But at that moment the guard renewed his grip and continued his
original purpose of lugging his prisoners to the airlock. He was
obviously quite touched.
"No, I think if it's all the same to you," he said, "I'd better
get you both shoved into this airlock and then go and get on with
some other bits of shouting I've got to do."
It wasn't all the same to Ford Prefect after all.
"Come on now ... but look!" he said, less slowly, less brightly.
"Huhhhhgggggggnnnnnnn ..." said Arthur without any clear
inflection.
"But hang on," pursued Ford, "there's music and art and things to
tell you about yet! Arrrggghhh!"
"Resistance is useless," bellowed the guard, and then added, "You
see if I keep it up I can eventually get promoted to Senior
Shouting Officer, and there aren't usually many vacancies for
non-shouting and non-pushing-people-about officers, so I think
I'd better stick to what I know."
They had now reached the airlock - a large circular steel
hatchway of massive strength and weight let into the inner skin
of the craft. The guard operated a control and the hatchway swung
smoothly open.
"But thanks for taking an interest," said the Vogon guard. "Bye
now." He flung Ford and Arthur through the hatchway into the
small chamber within. Arthur lay panting for breath. Ford
scrambled round and flung his shoulder uselessly against the
reclosing hatchway.
"But listen," he shouted to the guard, "there's a whole world you
don't know anything about ... here how about this?" Desperately
he grabbed for the only bit of culture he knew offhand - he
hummed the first bar of Beethoven's Fifth.
"Da da da dum! Doesn't that stir anything in you?"
"No," said the guard, "not really. But I'll mention it to my
aunt."
If he said anything further after that it was lost. The hatchway
sealed itself tight, and all sound was lost but the faint distant
hum of the ship's engines.
They were in a brightly polished cylindrical chamber about six
feet in diameter and ten feet long.
"Potentially bright lad I thought," he said and slumped against
the curved wall.
Arthur was still lying in the curve of the floor where he had
fallen. He didn't look up. He just lay panting.
"We're trapped now aren't we?"
"Yes," said Ford, "we're trapped."
"Well didn't you think of anything? I thought you said you were
going to think of something. Perhaps you thought of something and
didn't notice."
"Oh yes, I thought of something," panted Ford. Arthur looked up
expectantly.
"But unfortunately," continued Ford, "it rather involved being on
the other side of this airtight hatchway." He kicked the hatch
they'd just been through.
"But it was a good idea was it?"
"Oh yes, very neat."
"What was it?"
"Well I hadn't worked out the details yet. Not much point now is
there?"
"So ... er, what happens next?"
"Oh, er, well the hatchway in front of us will open automatically
in a few moments and we will shoot out into deep space I expect
and asphyxicate. If you take a lungful of air with you you can
last for up to thirty seconds of course ..." said Ford. He stuck
his hands behind his back, raised his eyebrows and started to hum
an old Betelgeusian battle hymn. To Arthur's eyes he suddenly
looked very alien.
"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die."
"Yes," said Ford, "except ... no! Wait a minute!" he suddenly
lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of
vision. "What's this switch?" he cried.
"What? Where?" cried Arthur twisting round.
"No, I was only fooling," said Ford, "we are going to die after
all."
He slumped against the wall again and carried on the tune from
where he left off.
"You know," said Arthur, "it's at times like this, when I'm
trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about
to die of asphyxication in deep space that I really wish I'd
listened to what my mother told me when I was young."
"Why, what did she tell you?"
"I don't know, I didn't listen."
"Oh." Ford carried on humming.
"This is terrific," Arthur thought to himself, "Nelson's Column
has gone, McDonald's have gone, all that's left is me and the
words Mostly Harmless. Any second now all that will be left is
Mostly Harmless. And yesterday the planet seemed to be going so
well."
A motor whirred.
A slight hiss built into a deafening roar of rushing air as the
outer hatchway opened on to an empty blackness studded with tiny
impossibly bright points of light. Ford and Arthur popped into
outer space like corks from a toy gun.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable
book. It has been compiled and recompiled many times over many
years and under many different editorships. It contains
contributions from countless numbers of travellers and
researchers.
The introduction begins like this:
"Space," it says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how
vastly hugely mindboggingly big it is. I mean you may think it's
a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts
to space. Listen ..." and so on.
(After a while the style settles down a bit and it begins to tell
you things you really need to know, like the fact that the
fabulously beautiful planet Bethselamin is now so worried about
the cumulative erosion by ten billion visiting tourists a year
that any net imbalance between the amount you eat and the amount
you excrete whilst on the planet is surgically removed from your
bodyweight when you leave: so every time you go to the lavatory
it is vitally important to get a receipt.)
To be fair though, when confronted by the sheer enormity of
distances between the stars, better minds than the one
responsible for the Guide's introduction have faltered. Some
invite you to consider for a moment a peanut in reading and a
small walnut in Johannesburg, and other such dizzying concepts.
The simple truth is that interstellar distances will not fit into
the human imagination.
Even light, which travels so fast that it takes most races
thousands of years to realize that it travels at all, takes time
to journey between the stars. It takes eight minutes from the
star Sol to the place where the Earth used to be, and four years
more to arrive at Sol's nearest stellar neighbour, Alpha Proxima.
For light to reach the other side of the Galaxy, for it to reach
Damogran for instance, takes rather longer: five hundred thousand
years.
The record for hitch hiking this distance is just under five
years, but you don't get to see much on the way.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy says that if you hold a
lungful of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for
about thirty seconds. However it goes on to say that what with
space being the mind boggling size it is the chances of getting
picked up by another ship within those thirty seconds are two to
the power of two hundred and sixty-seven thousand seven hundred
and nine to one against.
By a totally staggering coincidence that is also the telephone
number of an Islington flat where Arthur once went to a very good
party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to get off
with - she went off with a gatecrasher.
Though the planet Earth, the Islington flat and the telephone
have all now been demolished, it is comforting to reflect that
they are all in some small way commemorated by the fact that
twenty-nine seconds later Ford and Arthur were rescued.
A computer chatted to itself in alarm as it noticed an airlock
open and close itself for no apparent reason.
This was because Reason was in fact out to lunch.
A hole had just appeared in the Galaxy. It was exactly a
nothingth of a second long, a nothingth of an inch wide, and
quite a lot of million light years from end to end.
As it closed up lots of paper hats and party balloons fell out of
it and drifted off through the universe. A team of seven three-
foot-high market analysts fell out of it and died, partly of
asphyxication, partly of surprise.
Two hundred and thirty-nine thousand lightly fried eggs fell out
of it too, materializing in a large woobly heap on the famine-
struck land of Poghril in the Pansel system.
The whole Poghril tribe had died out from famine except for one
last man who died of cholesterol poisoning some weeks later.
The nothingth of a second for which the hole existed reverberated
backwards and forwards through time in a most improbable fashion.
Somewhere in the deeply remote past it seriously traumatized a
small random group of atoms drifting through the empty sterility
of space and made them cling together in the most extraordinarily
unlikely patterns. These patterns quickly learnt to copy
themselves (this was part of what was so extraordinary of the
patterns) and went on to cause massive trouble on every planet
they drifted on to. That was how life began in the Universe.
Five wild Event Maelstroms swirled in vicious storms of unreason
and spewed up a pavement.
On the pavement lay Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent gulping like
half-spent fish.
"There you are," gasped Ford, scrabbling for a fingerhold on the
pavement as it raced through the Third Reach of the Unknown, "I
told you I'd think of something."
"Oh sure," said Arthur, "sure."
"Bright idea of mine," said Ford, "to find a passing spaceship
and get rescued by it."
The real universe arched sickeningly away beneath them. Various
pretend ones flitted silently by, like mountain goats. Primal
light exploded, splattering space-time as with gobbets of junket.
Time blossomed, matter shrank away. The highest prime number
coalesced quietly in a corner and hid itself away for ever.
"Oh come off it," said Arthur, "the chances against it were
astronomical."
"Don't knock it, it worked," said Ford.
"What sort of ship are we in?" asked Arthur as the pit of
eternity yawned beneath them.
"I don't know," said Ford, "I haven't opened my eyes yet."
"No, nor have I," said Arthur.
The Universe jumped, froze, quivered and splayed out in several
unexpected directions.
Arthur and Ford opened their eyes and looked about in
considerable surprise.
"Good god," said Arthur, "it looks just like the sea front at
Southend."
"Hell, I'm relieved to hear you say that," said Ford.
"Why?"
"Because I thought I must be going mad."
"Perhaps you are. Perhaps you only thought I said it."
Ford thought about this.
"Well, did you say it or didn't you?" he asked.
"I think so," said Arthur.
"Well, perhaps we're both going mad."
"Yes," said Arthur, "we'd be mad, all things considered, to think
this was Southend."
"Well, do you think this is Southend?"
"Oh yes."
"So do I."
"Therefore we must be mad."
"Nice day for it."
"Yes," said a passing maniac.
"Who was that?" asked Arthur
"Who - the man with the five heads and the elderberry bush full
of kippers?"
"Yes."
"I don't know. Just someone."
"Ah."
They both sat on the pavement and watched with a certain unease
as huge children bounced heavily along the sand and wild horses
thundered through the sky taking fresh supplies of reinforced
railings to the Uncertain Areas.
"You know," said Arthur with a slight cough, "if this is
Southend, there's something very odd about it ..."
"You mean the way the sea stays steady and the buildings keep
washing up and down?" said Ford. "Yes I thought that was odd too.
In fact," he continued as with a huge bang Southend split itself
into six equal segments which danced and span giddily round each
other in lewd and licentious formation, "there is something
altogether very strange going on."
Wild yowling noises of pipes and strings seared through the wind,
hot doughnuts popped out of the road for ten pence each, horrid
fish stormed out of the sky and Arthur and Ford decided to make a
run for it.
They plunged through heavy walls of sound, mountains of archaic 
thought, valleys of mood music, bad shoe sessions and footling
bats and suddenly heard a girl's voice.
It sounded quite a sensible voice, but it just said, "Two to the
power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling," and
that was all.
Ford skidded down a beam of light and span round trying to find a
source for the voice but could see nothing he could seriously
believe in.
"What was that voice?" shouted Arthur.
"I don't know," yelled Ford, "I don't know. It sounded like a
measurement of probability."
"Probability? What do you mean?"
"Probability. You know, like two to one, three to one, five to
four against. It said two to the power of one hundred thousand to
one against. That's pretty improbable you know."
A million-gallon vat of custard upended itself over them without
warning.
"But what does it mean?" cried Arthur.
"What, the custard?"
"No, the measurement of probability!"
"I don't know. I don't know at all. I think we're on some kind of
spaceship."
"I can only assume," said Arthur, "that this is not the first-
class compartment."
Bulges appeared in the fabric of space-time. Great ugly bulges.
"Haaaauuurrgghhh ..." said Arthur as he felt his body softening
and bending in unusual directions. "Southend seems to be melting
away ... the stars are swirling ... a dustbowl ... my legs are
drifting off into the sunset ... my left arm's come off too." A
frightening thought struck him: "Hell," he said, "how am I going
to operate my digital watch now?" He wound his eyes desperately
around in Ford's direction.
"Ford," he said, "you're turning into a penguin. Stop it."
Again came the voice.
"Two to the power of seventy-five thousand to one against and
falling."
Ford waddled around his pond in a furious circle.
"Hey, who are you," he quacked. "Where are you? What's going on
and is there any way of stopping it?"
"Please relax," said the voice pleasantly, like a stewardess in
an airliner with only one wing and two engines one of which is on
fire, "you are perfectly safe."
"But that's not the point!" raged Ford. "The point is that I am
now a perfectly save penguin, and my colleague here is rapidly
running out of limbs!"
"It's alright, I've got them back now," said Arthur.
"Two to the power of fifty thousand to one against and falling,"
said the voice.
"Admittedly," said Arthur, "they're longer than I usually like
them, but ..."
"Isn't there anything," squawked Ford in avian fury, "you feel
you ought to be telling us?"
The voice cleared its throat. A giant petit four lolloped off
into the distance.
"Welcome," the voice said, "to the Starship Heart of Gold."
The voice continued.
"Please do not be alarmed," it said, "by anything you see or hear
around you. You are bound to feel some initial ill effects as you
have been rescued from certain death at an improbability level of
two to the power of two hundred and seventy-six thousand to one
against - possibly much higher. We are now cruising at a level of
two to the power of twenty-five thousand to one against and
falling, and we will be restoring normality just as soon as we
are sure what is normal anyway. Thank you. Two to the power of
twenty thousand to one against and falling."
The voice cut out.
Ford and Arthur were in a small luminous pink cubicle.
Ford was wildly excited.
"Arthur!" he said, "this is fantastic! We've been picked up by a
ship powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive! This is
incredible! I heard rumors about it before! They were all
officially denied, but they must have done it! They've built the
Improbability Drive! Arthur, this is ... Arthur? What's
happening?"
Arthur had jammed himself against the door to the cubicle, trying
to hold it closed, but it was ill fitting. Tiny furry little
hands were squeezing themselves through the cracks, their fingers
were inkstained; tiny voices chattered insanely.
Arthur looked up.
"Ford!" he said, "there's an infinite number of monkeys outside
who want to talk to us about this script for Hamlet they've
worked out."
The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of
crossing vast interstellar distances in a mere nothingth of a
second, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace.
It was discovered by a lucky chance, and then developed into a
governable form of propulsion by the Galactic Government's
research team on Damogran.
This, briefly, is the story of its discovery.
The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability
by simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny Sub-
Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong
Brownian Motion producer (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of
course well understood - and such generators were often used to
break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the
hostess's undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left,
in accordance with the Theory of Indeterminacy.
Many respectable physicists said that they weren't going to stand
for this - partly because it was a debasement of science, but
mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.
Another thing they couldn't stand was the perpetual failure they
encountered in trying to construct a machine which could generate
the infinite improbability field needed to flip a spaceship
across the mind-paralysing distances between the furthest stars,
and in the end they grumpily announced that such a machine was
virtually impossible.
Then, one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab
after a particularly unsuccessful party found himself reasoning
this way:
If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual
impossibility, then it must logically be a finite improbability.
So all I have to do in order to make one is to work out exactly
how improbable it is, feed that figure into the finite
improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of really hot tea
... and turn it on!
He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had
managed to create the long sought after golden Infinite
Improbability generator out of thin air.
It startled him even more when just after he was awarded the
Galactic Institute's Prize for Extreme Cleverness he got lynched
by a rampaging mob of respectable physicists who had finally
realized that the one thing they really couldn't stand was a
smartass.
The Improbability-proof control cabin of the Heart of Gold looked
like a perfectly conventional spaceship except that it was
perfectly clean because it was so new. Some of the control seats
hadn't had the plastic wrapping taken off yet. The cabin was
mostly white, oblong, and about the size of a smallish
restaurant. In fact it wasn't perfectly oblong: the two long
walls were raked round in a slight parallel curve, and all the
angles and corners were contoured in excitingly chunky shapes.
The truth of the matter is that it would have been a great deal
simpler and more practical to build the cabin as an ordinary
three-dimensional oblong rom, but then the designers would have
got miserable. As it was the cabin looked excitingly purposeful,
with large video screens ranged over the control and guidance
system panels on the concave wall, and long banks of computers
set into the convex wall. In one corner a robot sat humped, its
gleaming brushed steel head hanging loosely between its gleaming
brushed steel knees. It too was fairly new, but though it was
beautifully constructed and polished it somehow looked as if the
various parts of its more or less humanoid body didn't quite fit
properly. In fact they fitted perfectly well, but something in
its bearing suggested that they might have fitted better.
Zaphod Beeblebrox paced nervously up and down the cabin, brushing
his hands over pieces of gleaming equipment and giggling with
excitement.
Trillian sat hunched over a clump of instruments reading off
figures. Her voice was carried round the Tannoy system of the
whole ship.
"Five to one against and falling ..." she said, "four to one
against and falling ... three to one ... two ... one ...
probability factor of one to one ... we have normality, I repeat
we have normality." She turned her microphone off - then turned
it back on, with a slight smile and continued: "Anything you
still can't cope with is therefore your own problem. Please
relax. You will be sent for soon."
Zaphod burst out in annoyance: "Who are they Trillian?"
Trillian span her seat round to face him and shrugged.
"Just a couple of guys we seem to have picked up in open space,"
she said. "Section ZZ Plural Z Alpha."
"Yeah, well that's a very sweet thought Trillian," complained
Zaphod, "but do you really think it's wise under the
circumstances? I mean, here we are on the run and everything, we
must have the police of half the Galaxy after us by now, and we
stop to pick up hitch hikers. OK, so ten out of ten for style,
but minus several million for good thinking, yeah?"
He tapped irritably at a control panel. Trillian quietly moved
his hand before he tapped anything important. Whatever Zaphod's
qualities of mind might include - dash, bravado, conceit - he was
mechanically inept and could easily blow the ship up with an
extravagant gesture. Trillian had come to suspect that the main
reason why he had had such a wild and successful life that he
never really understood the significance of anything he did.
"Zaphod," she said patiently, "they were floating unprotected in
open space ... you wouldn't want them to have died would you?"
"Well, you know ... no. Not as such, but ..."
"Not as such? Not die as such? But?" Trillian cocked her head on
one side.
"Well, maybe someone else might have picked them up later."
"A second later and they would have been dead."
"Yeah, so if you'd taken the trouble to think about the problem a
bit longer it would have gone away."
"You'd been happy to let them die?"
"Well, you know, not happy as such, but ..."
"Anyway," said Trillian, turning back to the controls, "I didn't
pick them up."
"What do you mean? Who picked them up then?"
"The ship did."
"Huh?"
"The ship did. All by itself."
"Huh?"
"Whilst we were in Improbability Drive."
"But that's incredible."
"No Zaphod. Just very very improbable."
"Er, yeah."
"Look Zaphod," she said, patting his arm, "don't worry about the
aliens. They're just a couple of guys I expect. I'll send the
robot down to get them and bring them up here. Hey Marvin!"
In the corner, the robot's head swung up sharply, but then
wobbled about imperceptibly. It pulled itself up to its feet as
if it was about five pounds heavier that it actually was, and
made what an outside observer would have thought was a heroic
effort to cross the room. It stopped in front of Trillian and
seemed to stare through her left shoulder.
"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said.
Its voice was low and hopeless.
"Oh God," muttered Zaphod and slumped into a seat.
"Well," said Trillian in a bright compassionate tone, "here's
something to occupy you and keep your mind off things."
"It won't work," droned Marvin, "I have an exceptionally large
mind."
"Marvin!" warned Trillian.
"Alright," said Marvin, "what do you want me to do?"
"Go down to number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here
under surveillance."
With a microsecond pause, and a finely calculated micromodulation
of pitch and timbre - nothing you could actually take offence at
- Marvin managed to convey his utter contempt and horror of all
things human.
"Just that?" he said.
"Yes," said Trillian firmly.
"I won't enjoy it," said Marvin.
Zaphod leaped out of his seat.
"She's not asking you to enjoy it," he shouted, "just do it will
you?"
"Alright," said Marvin like the tolling of a great cracked bell,
"I'll do it."
"Good ..." snapped Zaphod, "great ... thank you ..."
Marvin turned and lifted his flat-topped triangular red eyes up
towards him.
"I'm not getting you down at all am I?" he said pathetically.
"No no Marvin," lilted Trillian, "that's just fine, really ..."
"I wouldn't like to think that I was getting you down."
"No, don't worry about that," the lilt continued, "you just act
as comes naturally and everything will be just fine."
"You're sure you don't mind?" probed Marvin.
"No no Marvin," lilted Trillian, "that's just fine, really ...
just part of life."
"Marvin flashed him an electronic look.
"Life," said Marvin, "don't talk to me about life."
He turned hopelessly on his heel and lugged himself out of the
cabin. With a satisfied hum and a click the door closed behind
him
"I don't think I can stand that robot much longer Zaphod,"
growled Trillian.
The Encyclopaedia Galactica defines a robot as a mechanical
apparatus designed to do the work of a man. The marketing
division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation defines a robot as
"Your Plastic Pal Who's Fun To Be With."
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy defines the marketing
division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation as "a bunch of
mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the
revolution comes," with a footnote to the effect that the editors
would welcome applications from anyone interested in taking over
the post of robotics correspondent.
Curiously enough, an edition of the Encyclopaedia Galactica that
had the good fortune to fall through a time warp from a thousand
years in the future defined the marketing division of the Sirius
Cybernetics Corporation as "a bunch of mindless jerks who were
the first against the wall when the revolution came."
The pink cubicle had winked out of existence, the monkeys had
sunk away to a better dimension. Ford and Arthur found themselves
in the embarkation area of the ship. It was rather smart.
"I think the ship's brand new," said Ford.
"How can you tell?" asked Arthur. "Have you got some exotic
device for measuring the age of metal?"
"No, I just found this sales brochure lying on the floor. It's a
lot of the Universe can be yours' stuff. Ah! Look, I was right."
Ford jabbed at one of the pages and showed it to Arthur.
"It says: Sensational new breakthrough in Improbability Physics.
As soon as the ship's drive reaches Infinite Improbability it
passes through every point in the Universe. Be the envy of other
major governments. Wow, this is big league stuff."
Ford hunted excitedly through the technical specs of the ship,
occasionally gasping with astonishment at what he read - clearly
Galactic astrotechnology had moved ahead during the years of his
exile.
Arthur listened for a short while, but being unable to understand
the vast majority of what Ford was saying he began to let his
mind wander, trailing his fingers along the edge of an
incomprehensible computer bank, he reached out and pressed an
invitingly large red button on a nearby panel. The panel lit up
with the words Please do not press this button again. He shook
himself.
"Listen," said Ford, who was still engrossed in the sales
brochure, "they make a big thing of the ship's cybernetics. A new
generation of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation robots and
computers, with the new GPP feature."
"GPP feature?" said Arthur. "What's that?"
"Oh, it says Genuine People Personalities."
"Oh," said Arthur, "sounds ghastly."
A voice behind them said, "It is." The voice was low and hopeless
and accompanied by a slight clanking sound. They span round and
saw an abject steel man standing hunched in the doorway.
"What?" they said.
"Ghastly," continued Marvin, "it all is. Absolutely ghastly. Just
don't even talk about it. Look at this door," he said, stepping
through it. The irony circuits cut into his voice modulator as he
mimicked the style of the sales brochure. "All the doors in this
spaceship have a cheerful and sunny disposition. It is their
pleasure to open for you, and their satisfaction to close again
with the knowledge of a job well done."
As the door closed behind them it became apparent that it did
indeed have a satisfied sigh-like quality to it.
"Hummmmmmmyummmmmmm ah!" it said.
Marvin regarded it with cold loathing whilst his logic circuits
chattered with disgust and tinkered with the concept of directing
physical violence against it Further circuits cut in saying, Why
bother? What's the point? Nothing is worth getting involved in.
Further circuits amused themselves by analysing the molecular
components of the door, and of the humanoids' brain cells. For a
quick encore they measured the level of hydrogen emissions in the
surrounding cubic parsec of space and then shut down again in
boredom. A spasm of despair shook the robot's body as he turned.
"Come on," he droned, "I've been ordered to take you down to the
bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a planet and they ask me to
take you down to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? 'Cos I
don't."
He turned and walked back to the hated door.
"Er, excuse me," said Ford following after him, "which government
owns this ship?"
Marvin ignored him.
"You watch this door," he muttered, "it's about to open again. I
can tell by the intolerable air of smugness it suddenly
generates."
With an ingratiating little whine the door slit open again and
Marvin stomped through.
"Come on," he said.
The others followed quickly and the door slit back into place
with pleased little clicks and whirrs.
"Thank you the marketing division of the Sirius Cybernetics
Corporation," said Marvin and trudged desolately up the gleaming
curved corridor that stretched out before them. "Let's build
robots with Genuine People Personalities," they said. So they
tried it out with me. I'm a personality prototype. You can tell
can't you?"
Ford and Arthur muttered embarrassed little disclaimers.
"I hate that door," continued Marvin. "I'm not getting you down
at all am I?"
"Which government ..." started Ford again.
"No government owns it," snapped the robot, "it's been stolen."
"Stolen?"
"Stolen?" mimicked Marvin.
"Who by?" asked Ford.
"Zaphod Beeblebrox."
Something extraordinary happened to Ford's face. At least five
entirely separate and distinct expressions of shock and amazement
piled up on it in a jumbled mess. His left leg, which was in mid
stride, seemed to have difficulty in finding the floor again. He
stared at the robot and tried to entangle some dartoid muscles.
"Zaphod Beeblebrox ...?" he said weakly.
"Sorry, did I say something wrong?" said Marvin, dragging himself
on regardless. "Pardon me for breathing, which I never do anyway
so I don't know why I bother to say it, oh God I'm so depressed.
Here's another of those self-satisfied door. Life! Don't talk to
me about life."
"No one ever mentioned it," muttered Arthur irritably. "Ford, are
you alright?"
Ford stared at him. "Did that robot say Zaphod Beeblebrox?" he
said.
A loud clatter of gunk music flooded through the Heart of Gold
cabin as Zaphod searched the sub-etha radio wavebands for news of
himself. The machine was rather difficult to operate. For years
radios had been operated by means of pressing buttons and turning
dials; then as the technology became more sophisticated the
controls were made touch-sensitive - you merely had to brush the
panels with your fingers; now all you had to do was wave your
hand in the general direction of the components and hope. It
saved a lot of muscular expenditure of course, but meant that you
had to sit infuriatingly still if you wanted to keep listening to
the same programme.
Zaphod waved a hand and the channel switched again. More gunk
music, but this time it was a background to a news announcement.
The news was always heavily edited to fit the rhythms of the
music.
"... and news brought to you here on the sub-etha wave band,
broadcasting around the galaxy around the clock," squawked a
voice, "and we'll be saying a big hello to all intelligent life
forms everywhere ... and to everyone else out there, the secret
is to bang the rocks together, guys. And of course, the big news
story tonight is the sensational theft of the new Improbability
Drive prototype ship by none other than Galactic President Zaphod
Beeblebrox. And the question everyone's asking is ... has the big
Z finally flipped? Beeblebrox, the man who invented the Pan
Galactic Gargle Blaster, ex-confidence trickster, once described
by Eccentrica Gallumbits as the Best Bang since the Big One, and
recently voted the Wort Dressed Sentinent Being in the Known
Universe for the seventh time ... has he got an answer this time?
We asked his private brain care specialist Gag Halfrunt ..." The
music swirled and dived for a moment. Another voice broke in,
presumably Halfrunt. He said: "Vell, Zaphod's jist zis guy you
know?" but got no further because an electric pencil flew across
the cabin and through the radio's on off sensitive airspace.
Zaphod turned and glared at Trillian - she had thrown the pencil.
"Hey," he said, what do you do that for?"
Trillian was tapping her fingers on a screenful of figures.
"I've just thought of something," she said.
"Yeah? Worth interrupting a news bulletin about me for?"
"You hear enough about yourself as it is."
"I'm very insecure. We know that."
"Can we drop your ego for a moment? This is important."
"If there's anything more important than my ego around, I want it
caught and shot now." Zaphod glared at her again, then laughed.
"Listen," she said, "we picked up those couple of guys ..."
"What couple of guys?"
"The couple of guys we picked up."
"Oh, yeah," said Zaphod, "those couple of guys."
"We picked them up in sector ZZ Plural Z Alpha."
"Yeah?" said Zaphod and blinked.
Trillian said quietly, "Does that mean anything to you?"
"Mmmmm," said Zaphod, "ZZ Plural Z Alpha. ZZ Plural Z Alpha?"
"Well?" said Trillian.
"Er ... what does the Z mean?" said Zaphod.
"Which one?"
"Any one."
One of the major difficulties Trillian experienced in her
relationship with Zaphod was learning to distinguish between him
pretending to be stupid just to get people off their guard,
pretending to be stupid because he couldn't be bothered to think
and wanted someone else to do it for him, pretending to be
outrageously stupid to hide the fact that he actually didn't
understand what was going on, and really being genuinely stupid.
He was renowned for being amazingly clever and quite clearly was
so - but not all the time, which obviously worried him, hence the
act. He proffered people to be puzzled rather than contemptuous.
This above all appeared to Trillian to be genuinely stupid, but
she could no longer be bothered to argue about it.
She sighed and punched up a star map on the visiscreen so she
could make it simple for him, whatever his reasons for wanting it
to be that way.
"There," she pointed, "right there."
"Hey ... Yeah!" said Zaphod.
"Well?" she said.
"Well what?"
Parts of the inside of her head screamed at other parts of the
inside of her head. She said, very calmly, "It's the same sector
you originally picked me up in."
He looked at her and then looked back at the screen.
"Hey, yeah," he said, "now that is wild. We should have zapped
straight into the middle of the Horsehead Nebula. How did we come
to be there? I mean that's nowhere."
She ignored this.
"Improbability Drive," she said patiently. "You explained it to
me yourself. We pass through every point in the Universe, you
know that."
"Yeah, but that's one wild coincidence isn't it?"
"Yes."
"Picking someone up at that point? Out of the whole of the
Universe to choose from? That's just too ... I want to work this
out. Computer!"
The Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Shipboard Computer which
controlled and permeated every particle of the ship switched
into communication mode.
"Hi there!" it said brightly and simultaneously spewed out a tiny
ribbon of ticker tape just for the record. The ticker tape said,
Hi there!
"Oh God," said Zaphod. He hadn't worked with this computer for
long but had already learned to loathe it.
The computer continued, brash and cheery as if it was selling
detergent.
"I want you to know that whatever your problem, I am here to help
you solve it."
"Yeah yeah," said Zaphod. "Look, I think I'll just use a piece of
paper."
"Sure thing," said the computer, spilling out its message into a
waste bin at the same time, "I understand. If you ever want ..."
"Shut up!" said Zaphod, and snatching up a pencil sat down next
to Trillian at the console.
"OK, OK ..." said the computer in a hurt tone of voice and closed
down its speech channel again.
Zaphod and Trillian pored over the figures that the Improbability
flight path scanner flashed silently up in front of them.
"Can we work out," said Zaphod, "from their point of view what
the Improbability of their rescue was?"
"Yes, that's a constant", said Trillian, "two to the power of two
hundred and seventy-six thousand seven hundred and nine to one
against."
"That's high. They're two lucky lucky guys."
"Yes."
"But relative to what we were doing when the ship picked them up
..."
Trillian punched up the figures. They showed tow-to-the power-
of-Infinity-minus-one (an irrational number that only has a
conventional meaning in Improbability physics).
"... it's pretty low," continued Zaphod with a slight whistle.
"Yes," agreed Trillian, and looked at him quizzically.
"That's one big whack of Improbability to be accounted for.
Something pretty improbable has got to show up on the balance
sheet if it's all going to add up into a pretty sum."
Zaphod scribbled a few sums, crossed them out and threw the
pencil away.
"Bat's dots, I can't work it out."
"Well?"
Zaphod knocked his two heads together in irritation and gritted
his teeth.
"OK," he said. "Computer!"
The voice circuits sprang to life again.
"Why hello there!" they said (ticker tape, ticker tape). "All I
want to do is make your day nicer and nicer and nicer ..."
"Yeah well shut up and work something out for me."
"Sure thing," chattered the computer, "you want a probability
forecast based on ..."
"Improbability data, yeah."
"OK," the computer continued. "Here's an interesting little
notion. Did you realize that most people's lives are governed by
telephone numbers?"
A pained look crawled across one of Zaphod's faces and on to the
other one.
"Have you flipped?" he said.
"No, but you will when I tell you that ..."
Trillian gasped. She scrabbled at the buttons on the
Improbability flight path screen.
"Telephone number?" she said. "Did that thing say telephone
number?"
Numbers flashed up on the screen.
The computer had paused politely, but now it continued.
"What I was about to say was that ..."
"Don't bother please," said Trillian.
"Look, what is this?" said Zaphod.
"I don't know," said Trillian, "but those aliens - they're on the
way up to the bridge with that wretched robot. Can we pick them
up on any monitor cameras?"
Marvin trudged on down the corridor, still moaning.
"... and then of course I've got this terrible pain in all the
diodes down my left hand side ..."
"No?" said Arthur grimly as he walked along beside him. "Really?"
"Oh yes," said Marvin, "I mean I've asked for them to be replaced
but no one ever listens."
"I can imagine."
Vague whistling and humming noises were coming from Ford. "Well
well well," he kept saying to himself, "Zaphod Beeblebrox ..."
Suddenly Marvin stopped, and held up a hand.
"You know what's happened now of course?"
"No, what?" said Arthur, who didn't what to know.
"We've arrived at another of those doors."
There was a sliding door let into the side of the corridor.
Marvin eyed it suspiciously.
"Well?" said Ford impatiently. "Do we go through?"
"Do we go through?" mimicked Marvin. "Yes. This is the entrance
to the bridge. I was told to take you to the bridge. Probably the
highest demand that will be made on my intellectual capacities
today I shouldn't wonder."
Slowly, with great loathing, he stepped towards the door, like a
hunter stalking his prey. Suddenly it slid open.
"Thank you," it said, "for making a simple door very happy."
Deep in Marvin's thorax gears ground.
"Funny," he intoned funerally, "how just when you think life
can't possibly get any worse it suddenly does."
He heaved himself through the door and left Ford and Arthur
staring at each other and shrugging their shoulders. From inside
they heard Marvin's voice again.
"I suppose you want to see the aliens now," he said. "Do you want
me to sit in a corner and rust, or just fall apart where I'm
standing?"
"Yeah, just show them in would you Marvin?" came another voice.
Arthur looked at Ford and was astonished to see him laughing.
"What's ...?"
"Shhh," said Ford, "come in."
He stepped through into the bridge.
Arthur followed him in nervously and was astonished to see a man
lolling back in a chair with his feet on a control console
picking the teeth in his right-hand head with his left hand. The
right-hand head seemed to be thoroughly preoccupied with this
task, but the left-hand one was grinning a broad, relaxed,
nonchalant grin. The number of things that Arthur couldn't
believe he was seeing was fairly large. His jaw flapped about at
a loose end for a while.
The peculiar man waved a lazy wave at Ford and with an appalling
affectation of nonchalance said, "Ford, hi, how are you? Glad you
could drop in."
Ford was not going to be outcooled.
"Zaphod," he drawled, "great to see you, you're looking well, the
extra arm suits you. Nice ship you've stolen."
Arthur goggled at him.
"You mean you know this guy?" he said, waving a wild finger at
Zaphod.
"Know him!" exclaimed Ford, "he's ..." he paused, and decided to
do the introductions the other way round.
"Oh, Zaphod, this is a friend of mine, Arthur Dent," he said, "I
saved him when his planet blew up."
"Oh sure," said Zaphod, "hi Arthur, glad you could make it." His
right-hand head looked round casually, said "hi" and went back to
having his teeth picked.
Ford carried on. "And Arthur," he said, "this is my semi-cousin
Zaphod Beeb ..."
"We've met," said Arthur sharply.
When you're cruising down the road in the fast lane and you
lazily sail past a few hard driving cars and are feeling pretty
pleased with yourself and then accidentally change down from
fourth to first instead of third thus making your engine leap out
of your bonnet in a rather ugly mess, it tends to throw you off
your stride in much the same way that this remark threw Ford
Prefect off his.
"Err ... what?"
"I said we've met."
Zaphod gave an awkward start of surprise and jabbed a gum
sharply.
"Hey ... er, have we? Hey ... er ..."
Ford rounded on Arthur with an angry flash in his eyes. Now he
felt he was back on home ground he suddenly began to resent
having lumbered himself with this ignorant primitive who knew as
much about the affairs of the Galaxy as an Ilford-based gnat knew
about life in Peking.
"What do you mean you've met?" he demanded. "This is Zaphod
Beeblebrox from Betelgeuse Five you know, not bloody Martin Smith
from Croydon."
"I don't care," said Arthur coldly. We've met, haven't we Zaphod
Beeblebrox - or should I say ... Phil?"
"What!" shouted Ford.
"You'll have to remind me," said Zaphod. "I've a terrible memory
for species."
"It was at a party," pursued Arthur.
"Yeah, well I doubt that," said Zaphod.
"Cool it will you Arthur!" demanded Ford.
Arthur would not be deterred. "A party six months ago. On Earth
... England ..."
Zaphod shook his head with a tight-lipped smile.
"London," insisted Arthur, "Islington."
"Oh," said Zaphod with a guilty start, "that party."
This wasn't fair on Ford at all. He looked backwards and forwards
between Arthur and Zaphod. "What?" he said to Zaphod. "You don't
mean to say you've been on that miserable planet as well do you?"
"No, of course not," said Zaphod breezily. "Well, I may have just
dropped in briefly, you know, on my way somewhere ..."
"But I was stuck there for fifteen years!"
"Well I didn't know that did I?"
"But what were you doing there?"
"Looking about, you know."
"He gatecrashed a party," persisted Arthur, trembling with anger,
"a fancy dress party ..."
"It would have to be, wouldn't it?" said Ford.
"At this party," persisted Arthur, "was a girl ... oh well, look
it doesn't matter now. The whole place has gone up in smoke
anyway ..."
"I wish you'd stop sulking about that bloody planet," said Ford.
"Who was the lady?"
"Oh just somebody. Well alright, I wasn't doing very well with
her. I'd been trying all evening. Hell, she was something though.
Beautiful, charming, devastatingly intelligent, at last I'd got
her to myself for a bit and was plying her with a bit of talk
when this friend of yours barges up and says Hey doll, is this
guy boring you? Why don't you talk to me instead? I'm from a
different planet." I never saw her again."
"Zaphod?" exclaimed Ford.
"Yes," said Arthur, glaring at him and trying not to feel
foolish. "He only had the two arms and the one head and he called
himself Phil, but ..."
"But you must admit he did turn out to be from another planet,"
said Trillian wandering into sight at the other end of the
bridge. She gave Arthur a pleasant smile which settled on him
like a ton of bricks and then turned her attention to the ship's
controls again.
There was silence for a few seconds, and then out of the
scrambled mess of Arthur's brain crawled some words.
"Tricia McMillian?" he said. "What are you doing here?"
"Same as you," she said, "I hitched a lift. After all with a
degree in Maths and another in astrophysics what else was there
to do? It was either that or the dole queue again on Monday."
"Infinity minus one," chattered the computer, "Improbability sum
now complete."
Zaphod looked about him, at Ford, at Arthur, and then at
Trillian.
"Trillian," he said, "is this sort of thing going to happen every
time we use the Improbability drive?"
"Very probably, I'm afraid," she said.
The Heart of Gold fled on silently through the night of space,
now on conventional photon drive. Its crew of four were ill at
ease knowing that they had been brought together not of their own
volition or by simple coincidence, but by some curious principle
of physics - as if relationships between people were susceptible
to the same laws that governed the relationships between atoms
and molecules.
As the ship's artificial night closed in they were each grateful
to retire to separate cabins and try to rationalize their
thoughts.
Trillian couldn't sleep. She sat on a couch and stared at a small
cage which contained her last and only links with Earth - two
white mice that she had insisted Zaphod let her bring. She had
expected not to see the planet again, but she was disturbed by
her negative reaction to the planet's destruction. It seemed
remote and unreal and she could find no thoughts to think about
it. She watched the mice scurrying round the cage and running
furiously in their little plastic treadwheels till they occupied
her whole attention. Suddenly she shook herself and went back to
the bridge to watch over the tiny flashing lights and figures
that charted the ship's progress through the void. She wished she
knew what it was she was trying not to think about.
Zaphod couldn't sleep. He also wished he knew what it was that he
wouldn't let himself think about. For as long as he could
remember he'd suffered from a vague nagging feeling of being not
all there. Most of the time he was able to put this thought aside
and not worry about it, but it had been re-awakened by the sudden
inexplicable arrival of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. Somehow it
seemed to conform to a pattern that he couldn't see.
Ford couldn't sleep. He was too excited about being back on the
road again. Fifteen years of virtual imprisonment were over, just
as he was finally beginning to give up hope. Knocking about with
Zaphod for a bit promised to be a lot of fun, though there seemed
to be something faintly odd about his semi-cousin that he
couldn't put his finger on. The fact that he had become President
of the Galaxy was frankly astonishing, as was the manner of his
leaving the post. Was there a reason behind it? There would be no
point in asking Zaphod, he never appeared to have a reason for
anything he did at all: he had turned unfathomably into an art
form. He attacked everything in life with a mixture of
extraordinary genius and naive incompetence and it was often
difficult to tell which was which.
Arthur slept: he was terribly tired.
There was a tap at Zaphod's door. It slid open.
"Zaphod ...?"
"Yeah?"
"I think we just found what you came to look for."
"Hey, yeah?"
Ford gave up the attempt to sleep. In the corner of his cabin was
a small computer screen and keyboard. He sat at it for a while
and tried to compose a new entry for the Guide on the subject of
Vogons but couldn't think of anything vitriolic enough so he gave
that up too, wrapped a robe round himself and went for a walk to
the bridge.
As he entered he was surprised to see two figures hunched
excitedly over the instruments.
"See? The ship's about to move into orbit," Trillian was saying.
"There's a planet out there. It's at the exact coordinates you
predicted."
Zaphod heard a noise and looked up.
"Ford!" he hissed. "Hey, come and take a look at this."
Ford went and had a look at it. It was a series of figures
flashing over a screen.
"You recognize those Galactic coordinates?" said Zaphod.
"No."
"I'll give you a clue. Computer!"
"Hi gang!" enthused the computer. "This is getting real sociable
isn't it?"
"Shut up," said Zaphod, "and show up the screens."
Light on the bridge sank. Pinpoints of light played across the
consoles and reflected in four pairs of eyes that stared up at
the external monitor screens.
There was absolutely nothing on them.
"Recognize that?" whispered Zaphod.
Ford frowned.
"Er, no," he said.
"What do you see?"
"Nothing."
"Recognize it?"
"What are you talking about?"
"We're in the Horsehead Nebula. One whole vast dark cloud."
"And I was meant to recognize that from a blank screen?"
"Inside a dark nebula is the only place in the Galaxy you'd see a
dark screen."
"Very good."
Zaphod laughed. He was clearly very excited about something,
almost childishly so.
"Hey, this is really terrific, this is just far too much!"
"What's so great about being stuck in a dust cloud?" said Ford.
"What would you reckon to find here?" urged Zaphod.
"Nothing."
"No stars? No planets?"
"No."
"Computer!" shouted Zaphod, "rotate angle of vision through one-
eighty degrees and don't talk about it!"
For a moment it seemed that nothing was happening, then a
brightness glowed at the edge of the huge screen. A red star the
size of a small plate crept across it followed quickly by another
one - a binary system. Then a vast crescent sliced into the
corner of the picture - a red glare shading away into the deep
black, the night side of the planet.
"I've found it!" cried Zaphod, thumping the console. "I've found
it!"
Ford stared at it in astonishment.
"What is it?" he said.
"That ..." said Zaphod, "is the most improbable planet that ever
existed."
(Excerpt from The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Page ,
Section a, Entry: Magrathea)
Far back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious
days of the former Galactic Empire, life was wild, rich and
largely tax free.
Mighty starships plied their way between exotic suns, seeking
adventure and reward amongst the furthest reaches of Galactic
space. In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high,
men were real men, women were real women, and small furry
creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures
from Alpha Centauri. And all dared to brave unknown terrors, to
do mighty deeds, to boldly split infinitives that no man had
split before - and thus was the Empire forged.
Many men of course became extremely rich, but this was perfectly
natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really
poor - at least no one worth speaking of. And for all the richest
and most successful merchants life inevitably became rather dull
and niggly, and they began to imagine that this was therefore the
fault of the worlds they'd settled on - none of them was entirely
satisfactory: either the climate wasn't quite right in the later
part of the afternoon, or the day was half an hour too long, or
the sea was exactly the wrong shade of pink.
And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of
specialist industry: custom-made luxury planet building. The home
of this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial
engineers sucked matter through white holes in space to form it
into dream planets - gold planets, platinum planets, soft rubber
planets with lots of earthquakes - all lovingly made to meet the
exacting standards that the Galaxy's richest men naturally came
to expect.
But so successful was this venture that Magrathea itself soon
became the richest planet of all time and the rest of the Galaxy
was reduced to abject poverty. And so the system broke down, the
Empire collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a
billion worlds, disturbed only by the pen scratchings of scholars
as they laboured into the night over smug little treaties on the
value of a planned political economy.
Magrathea itself disappeared and its memory soon passed into the
obscurity of legend.
In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of
it.
Arthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge.
Ford was waving his arms about.
"You're crazy, Zaphod," he was saying, "Magrathea is a myth, a
fairy story, it's what parents tell their kids about at night if
they want them to grow up to become economists, it's ..."
"And that's what we are currently in orbit around," insisted
Zaphod.
"Look, I can't help what you may personally be in orbit around,"
said Ford, "but this ship ..."
"Computer!" shouted Zaphod.
"Oh no ..."
"Hi there! This is Eddie your shipboard computer, and I'm feeling
just great guys, and I know I'm just going to get a bundle of
kicks out of any programme you care to run through me."
Arthur looked inquiringly at Trillian. She motioned him to come
on in but keep quiet.
"Computer," said Zaphod, "tell us again what our present
trajectory is."
"A real pleasure feller," it burbled, "we are currently in orbit
at an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet
of Magrathea."
"Proving nothing," said Ford. "I wouldn't trust that computer to
speak my weight."
"I can do that for you, sure," enthused the computer, punching
out more tickertape. "I can even work out you personality
problems to ten decimal places if it will help."
Trillian interrupted.
"Zaphod," she said, "any minute now we will be swinging round to
the daylight side of this planet," adding, "whatever it turns out
to be."
"Hey, what do you mean by that? The planet's where I predicted it
would be isn't it?"
"Yes, I know there's a planet there. I'm not arguing with anyone,
it's just that I wouldn't know Magrathea from any other lump of
cold rock. Dawn's coming up if you want it."
"OK, OK," muttered Zaphod, "let's at least give our eyes a good
time. Computer!"
"Hi there! What can I ..."
"Just shut up and give us a view of the planet again."
A dark featureless mass once more filled the screens - the planet
rolling away beneath them.
They watched for a moment in silence, but Zaphod was fidgety with
excitement.
"We are now traversing the night side ..." he said in a hushed
voice. The planet rolled on.
"The surface of the planet is now three hundred miles beneath us
..." he continued. He was trying to restore a sense of occasion
to what he felt should have been a great moment. Magrathea! He
was piqued by Ford's sceptical reaction. Magrathea!
"In a few seconds," he continued, "we should see ... there!"
The moment carried itself. Even the most seasoned star tramp
can't help but shiver at the spectacular drama of a sunrise seen
from space, but a binary sunrise is one of the marvels of the
Galaxy.
Out of the utter blackness stabbed a sudden point of blinding
light. It crept up by slight degrees and spread sideways in a
thin crescent blade, and within seconds two suns were visible,
furnaces of light, searing the black edge of the horizon with
white fire. Fierce shafts of colour streaked through the thin
atmosphere beneath them.
"The fires of dawn ... !" breathed Zaphod. "The twin suns of
Soulianis and Rahm ... !"
"Or whatever," said Ford quietly.
"Soulianis and Rahm!" insisted Zaphod.
The suns blazed into the pitch of space and a low ghostly music
floated through the bridge: Marvin was humming ironically because
he hated humans so much.
As Ford gazed at the spectacle of light before them excitement
burnt inside him, but only the excitement of seeing a strange new
planet, it was enough for him to see it as it was. It faintly
irritated him that Zaphod had to impose some ludicrous fantasy on
to the scene to make it work for him. All this Magrathea nonsense
seemed juvenile. Isn't it enough to see that a garden is
beautiful without having to believe that there are fairies at the
bottom of it too?
All this Magrathea business seemed totally incomprehensible to
Arthur. He edged up to Trillian and asked her what was going on.
"I only know what Zaphod's told me," she whispered. "Apparently
Magrathea is some kind of legend from way back which no one
seriously believes in. Bit like Atlantis on Earth, except that
the legends say the Magratheans used to manufacture planets."
Arthur blinked at the screens and felt he was missing something
important. Suddenly he realized what it was.
"Is there any tea on this spaceship?" he asked.
More of the planet was unfolding beneath them as the Heart of
Gold streaked along its orbital path. The suns now stood high in
the black sky, the pyrotechnics of dawn were over, and the
surface of the planet appeared bleak and forbidding in the common
light of day - grey, dusty and only dimly contoured. It looked
dead and cold as a crypt. From time to time promising features
would appear on the distant horizon - ravines, maybe mountains,
maybe even cities - but as they approached the lines would soften
and blur into anonymity and nothing would transpire. The planet's
surface was blurred by time, by the slow movement of the thin
stagnant air that had crept across it for century upon century.
Clearly, it was very very old.
A moment of doubt came to Ford as he watched the grey landscape
move beneath them. The immensity of time worried him, he could
feel it as a presence. He cleared his throat.
"Well, even supposing it is ..."
"It is," said Zaphod.
"Which it isn't," continued Ford. "What do you want with it
anyway? There's nothing there."
"Not on the surface," said Zaphod.
"Alright, just supposing there's something. I take it you're not
here for the sheer industrial archaeology of it all. What are you
after?"
One of Zaphod's heads looked away. The other one looked round to
see what the first was looking at, but it wasn't looking at
anything very much.
"Well," said Zaphod airily, "it's partly the curiosity, partly a
sense of adventure, but mostly I think it's the fame and the
money ..."
Ford glanced at him sharply. He got a very strong impression that
Zaphod hadn't the faintest idea why he was there at all.
"You know I don't like the look of that planet at all," said
Trillian shivering.
"Ah, take no notice," said Zaphod, "with half the wealth of the
former Galactic Empire stored on it somewhere it can afford to
look frumpy."
Bullshit, thought Ford. Even supposing this was the home of some
ancient civilization now gone to dust, even supposing a number of
exceedingly unlikely things, there was no way that vast treasures
of wealth were going to be stored there in any form that would
still have meaning now. He shrugged.
"I think it's just a dead planet," he said.
"The suspense is killing me," said Arthur testily.
Stress and nervous tension are now serious social problems in all
parts of the Galaxy, and it is in order that this situation
should not in any way be exacerbated that the following facts
will now be revealed in advance.
The planet in question is in fact the legendary Magrathea.
The deadly missile attack shortly to be launched by an ancient
automatic defence system will result merely in the breakage of
three coffee cups and a micecage, the bruising of somebody's
upper arm, and the untimely creation and sudden demise of a bowl
of petunias and an innocent sperm whale.
In order that some sense of mystery should still be preserved, no
revelation will yet be made concerning whose upper arm sustained
the bruise. This fact may safely be made the subject of suspense
since it is of no significance whatsoever.
After a fairly shaky start to the day, Arthur's mind was
beginning to reassemble itself from the shellshocked fragments
the previous day had left him with. He had found a Nutri-Matic
machine which had provided him with a plastic cup filled with a
liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The
way it functioned was very interesting. When the Drink button was
pressed it made an instant but highly detailed examination of the
subject's taste buds, a spectroscopic analysis of the subject's
metabolism and then sent tiny experimental signals down the
neural pathways to the taste centres of the subject's brain to
see what was likely to go down well. However, no one knew quite
why it did this because it invariably delivered a cupful of
liquid that was almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea. The
Nutri-Matic was designed and manufactured by the Sirius
Cybernetics Corporation whose complaints department now covers
all the major land masses of the first three planets in the
Sirius Tau Star system.
Arthur drank the liquid and found it reviving. He glanced up at
the screens again and watched a few more hundred miles of barren
greyness slide past. It suddenly occurred to him to ask a
question which had been bothering him.
"Is it safe?" he said.
"Magrathea's been dead for five million years," said Zaphod, "of
course it's safe. Even the ghosts will have settled down and
raised families by now." At which point a strange and
inexplicable sound thrilled suddenly through the bridge - a noise
as of a distant fanfare; a hollow, reedy, insubstantial sound. It
preceded a voice that was equally hollow, reedy and
insubstantial. The voice said "Greetings to you ..."
Someone from the dead planet was talking to them.
"Computer!" shouted Zaphod.
"Hi there!"
"What the photon is it?"
"Oh, just some five-million-year-old tape that's being broadcast
at us."
"A what? A recording?"
"Shush!" said Ford. "It's carrying on."
The voice was old, courteous, almost charming, but was
underscored with quite unmistakable menace.
"This is a recorded announcement," it said, "as I'm afraid we're
all out at the moment. The commercial council of Magrathea thanks
you for your esteemed visit ..."
("A voice from ancient Magrathea!" shouted Zaphod. "OK, OK," said
Ford.)
"... but regrets," continued the voice, "that the entire planet
is temporarily closed for business. Thank you. If you would care
to leave your name and the address of a planet where you can be
contacted, kindly speak when you hear the tone."
A short buzz followed, then silence.
"They want to get rid of us," said Trillian nervously. "What do
we do?"
"It's just a recording," said Zaphod. "We keep going. Got that,
computer?"
"I got it," said the computer and gave the ship an extra kick of
speed.
They waited.
After a second or so came the fanfare once again, and then the
voice.
"We would like to assure you that as soon as our business is
resumed announcements will be made in all fashionable magazines
and colour supplements, when our clients will once again be able
to select from all that's best in contemporary geography." The
menace in the voice took on a sharper edge. "Meanwhile we thank
our clients for their kind interest and would ask them to leave.
Now."
Arthur looked round the nervous faces of his companions.
"Well, I suppose we'd better be going then, hadn't we?" he
suggested.
"Shhh!" said Zaphod. "There's absolutely nothing to be worried
about."
"Then why's everyone so tense?"
"They're just interested!" shouted Zaphod. "Computer, start a
descent into the atmosphere and prepare for landing."
This time the fanfare was quite perfunctory, the voice distinctly
cold.
"It is most gratifying," it said, "that your enthusiasm for our
planet continues unabated, and so we would like to assure you
that the guided missiles currently converging with your ship are
part of a special service we extend to all of our most
enthusiastic clients, and the fully armed nuclear warheads are of
course merely a courtesy detail. We look forward to your custom
in future lives ... thank you."
The voice snapped off.
"Oh," said Trillian.
"Er ..." said Arthur.
"Well?" said Ford.
"Look," said Zaphod, "will you get it into your heads? That's
just a recorded message. It's millions of years old. It doesn't
apply to us, get it?"
"What," said Trillian quietly, "about the missiles?"
"Missiles? Don't make me laugh."
Ford tapped Zaphod on the shoulder and pointed at the rear
screen. Clear in the distance behind them two silver darts were
climbing through the atmosphere towards the ship. A quick change
of magnification brought them into close focus - two massively
real rockets thundering through the sky. The suddenness of it was
shocking.
"I think they're going to have a very good try at applying to
us," said Ford.
Zaphod stared at them in astonishment.
"Hey this is terrific!" he said. "Someone down there is trying to
kill us!"
"Terrific," said Arthur.
"But don't you see what this means?"
"Yes. We're going to die."
"Yes, but apart from that."
"Apart from that?"
"It means we must be on to something!"
"How soon can we get off it?"
Second by second the image of the missiles on the screen became
larger. They had swung round now on to a direct homing course so
that all that could be seen of them now was the warheads, head
on.
"As a matter of interest," said Trillian, "what are we going to
do?"
"Just keep cool," said Zaphod.
"Is that all?" shouted Arthur.
"No, we're also going to ... er ... take evasive action!" said
Zaphod with a sudden access of panic. "Computer, what evasive
action can we take?"
"Er, none I'm afraid, guys," said the computer.
"... or something," said Zaphod, "... er ..." he said.
"There seems to be something jamming my guidance system,"
explained the computer brightly, "impact minus forty-five
seconds. Please call me Eddie if it will help you to relax."
Zaphod tried to run in several equally decisive directions
simultaneously. "Right!" he said. "Er ... we've got to get manual
control of this ship."
"Can you fly her?" asked Ford pleasantly.
"No, can you?"
"No."
"Trillian, can you?"
"No."
"Fine," said Zaphod, relaxing. "We'll do it together."
"I can't either," said Arthur, who felt it was time he began to
assert himself.
"I'd guessed that," said Zaphod. "OK computer, I want full manual
control now."
"You got it," said the computer.
Several large desk panels slid open and banks of control consoles
sprang up out of them, showering the crew with bits of expanded
polystyrene packaging and balls of rolled-up cellophane: these
controls had never been used before.
Zaphod stared at them wildly.
"OK, Ford," he said, "full retro thrust and ten degrees
starboard. Or something ..."
"Good luck guys," chirped the computer, "impact minus thirty
seconds ..."
Ford leapt to the controls - only a few of them made any
immediate sense to him so he pulled those. The ship shook and
screamed as its guidance rocked jets tried to push it every which
way simultaneously. He released half of them and the ship span
round in a tight arc and headed back the way it had come,
straight towards the oncoming missiles.
Air cushions ballooned out of the walls in an instant as everyone
was thrown against them. For a few seconds the inertial forces
held them flattened and squirming for breath, unable to move.
Zaphod struggled and pushed in manic desperation and finally
managed a savage kick at a small lever that formed part of the
guidance system.
The lever snapped off. The ship twisted sharply and rocketed
upwards. The crew were hurled violently back across the cabin.
Ford's copy of The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy smashed into
another section of the control console with the combined result
that the guide started to explain to anyone who cared to listen
about the best ways of smuggling Antarean parakeet glands out of
Antares (an Antarean parakeet gland stuck on a small stick is a
revolting but much sought after cocktail delicacy and very large
sums of money are often paid for them by very rich idiots who
want to impress other very rich idiots), and the ship suddenly
dropped out of the sky like a stone.
It was of course more or less at this moment that one of the crew
sustained a nasty bruise to the upper arm. This should be
emphasized because, as had already been revealed, they escape
otherwise completely unharmed and the deadly nuclear missiles do
not eventually hit the ship. The safety of the crew is absolutely
assured.
"Impact minus twenty seconds, guys ..." said the computer.
"Then turn the bloody engines back on!" bawled Zaphod.
"OK, sure thing, guys," said the computer. With a subtle roar the
engines cut back in, the ship smoothly flattened out of its dive
and headed back towards the missiles again.
The computer started to sing.
"When you walk through the storm ..." it whined nasally, "hold
your head up high ..."
Zaphod screamed at it to shut up, but his voice was lost in the
din of what they quite naturally assumed was approaching
destruction.
"And don't ... be afraid ... of the dark!" Eddie wailed.
The ship, in flattening out had in fact flattened out upside down
and lying on the ceiling as they were it was now totally
impossible for any of the crew to reach the guidance systems.
"At the end of the storm ..." crooned Eddie.
The two missiles loomed massively on the screens as they
thundered towards the ship.
"... is a golden sky ..."
But by an extraordinarily lucky chance they had not yet fully
corrected their flight paths to that of the erratically weaving
ship, and they passed right under it.
"And the sweet silver songs of the lark ... Revised impact time
fifteen seconds fellas ... Walk on through the wind ..."
The missiles banked round in a screeching arc and plunged back
into pursuit.
"This is it," said Arthur watching them. "We are now quite
definitely going to die aren't we?"
"I wish you'd stop saying that," shouted Ford.
"Well we are aren't we?"
"Yes."
"Walk on through the rain ..." sang Eddie.
A thought struck Arthur. He struggled to his feet.
"Why doesn't anyone turn on this Improbability Drive thing?" he
said. "We could probably reach that."
"What are you crazy?" said Zaphod. "Without proper programming
anything could happen."
"Does that matter at this stage?" shouted Arthur.
"Though your dreams be tossed and blown ..." sand Eddie.
Arthur scrambled up on to one end of the excitingly chunky pieces
of moulded contouring where the curve of the wall met the
ceiling.
"Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart ..."
"Does anyone know why Arthur can't turn on the Improbability
Drive?" shouted Trillian.
"And you'll never walk alone ... Impact minus five seconds, it's
been great knowing you guys, God bless ... You'll ne ... ver ...
walk ... alone!"
"I said," yelled Trillian, "does anyone know ..."
The next thing that happened was a mid-mangling explosion of
noise and light.
And the next thing that happened after that was that the Heart of
Gold continued on its way perfectly normally with a rather
fetchingly redesigned interior. It was somewhat larger, and done
out in delicate pastel shades of green and blue. In the centre a
spiral staircase, leading nowhere in particular, stood in a spray
of ferns and yellow flowers and next to it a stone sundial
pedestal housed the main computer terminal. Cunningly deployed
lighting and mirrors created the illusion of standing in a
conservatory overlooking a wide stretch of exquisitely manicured
garden. Around the periphery of the conservatory area stood
marble-topped tables on intricately beautiful wrought-iron legs.
As you gazed into the polished surface of the marble the vague
forms of instruments became visible, and as you touched them the
instruments materialized instantly under your hands. Looked at
from the correct angles the mirrors appeared to reflect all the
required data readouts, though it was far from clear where they
were reflected from. It was in fact sensationally beautiful.
Relaxing in a wickerwork sun chair, Zaphod Beeblebrox said, "What
the hell happened?"
"Well I was just saying," said Arthur lounging by a small fish
pool, "there's this Improbability Drive switch over here ..." he
waved at where it had been. There was a potted plant there now.
"But where are we?" said Ford who was sitting on the spiral
staircase, a nicely chilled Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster in his
hand.
"Exactly where we were, I think ..." said Trillian, as all about
them the mirrors showed them an image of the blighted landscape
of Magrathea which still scooted along beneath them.
Zaphod leapt out of his seat.
"Then what's happened to the missiles?" he said.
A new and astounding image appeared in the mirrors.
"They would appear," said Ford doubtfully, "to have turned into a
bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale ..."
"At an Improbability Factor," cut in Eddie, who hadn't changed a
bit, "of eight million seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand one
hundred and twenty-eight to one against."
Zaphod stared at Arthur.
"Did you think of that, Earthman?" he demanded.
"Well," said Arthur, "all I did was ..."
"That's very good thinking you know. Turn on the Improbability
Drive for a second without first activating the proofing screens.
Hey kid you just saved our lives, you know that?"
"Oh," said Arthur, "well, it was nothing really ..."
"Was it?" said Zaphod. "Oh well, forget it then. OK, computer,
take us in to land."
"But ..."
"I said forget it."
Another thing that got forgotten was the fact that against all
probability a sperm whale had suddenly been called into existence
several miles above the surface of an alien planet.
And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale,
this poor innocent creature had very little time to come to terms
with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms
with not being a whale any more.
This is a complete record of its thoughts from the moment it
began its life till the moment it ended it.
Ah ... ! What's happening? it thought.
Er, excuse me, who am I?
Hello?
Why am I here? What's my purpose in life?
What do I mean by who am I?
Calm down, get a grip now ... oh! this is an interesting
sensation, what is it? It's a sort of ... yawning, tingling
sensation in my ... my ... well I suppose I'd better start
finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what
for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the
world, so let's call it my stomach.
Good. Ooooh, it's getting quite strong. And hey, what's about
this whistling roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going
to call my head? Perhaps I can call that ... wind! Is that a good
name? It'll do ... perhaps I can find a better name for it later
when I've found out what it's for. It must be something very
important because there certainly seems to be a hell of a lot of
it. Hey! What's this thing? This ... let's call it a tail - yeah,
tail. Hey! I can can really thrash it about pretty good can't I?
Wow! Wow! That feels great! Doesn't seem to achieve very much but
I'll probably find out what it's for later on. Now - have I built
up any coherent picture of things yet?
No. Never mind, hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out
about, so much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy with
anticipation ... Or is it the wind?
There really is a lot of that now isn't it?
And wow! Hey! What's this thing suddenly coming towards me very
fast? Very very fast. So big and flat and round, it needs a big
wide sounding name like ... ow ... ound ... round ... ground!
That's it! That's a good name - ground!
I wonder if it will be friends with me?
And the rest, after a sudden wet thud, was silence.
Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of
the bowl of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people
have speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias
had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the
universe than we do now.
"Are we taking this robot with us?" said Ford, looking with
distaste at Marvin who was standing in an awkward hunched posture
in the corner under a small palm tree.
Zaphod glanced away from the mirror screens which presented a
panoramic view of the blighted landscape on which the Heart of
Gold had now landed.
"Oh, the Paranoid Android," he said. "Yeah, we'll take him."
"But what are supposed to do with a manically depressed robot?"
"You think you've got problems," said Marvin as if he was
addressing a newly occupied coffin, "what are you supposed to do
if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don't bother to
answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you
and even I don't know the answer. It gives me a headache just
trying to think down to your level."
Trillian burst in through the door from her cabin.
"My white mice have escaped!" she said.
An expression of deep worry and concern failed to cross either of
Zaphod's faces.
"Nuts to your white mice," he said.
Trillian glared an upset glare at him, and disappeared again.
It is possible that her remark would have commanded greater
attention had it been generally realized that human beings were
only the third most intelligent life form present on the planet
Earth, instead of (as was generally thought by most independent
observers) the second.
"Good afternoon boys."
The voice was oddly familiar, but oddly different. It had a
matriarchal twang. It announced itself to the crew as they
arrived at the airlock hatchway that would let them out on the
planet surface.
They looked at each other in puzzlement.
"It's the computer," explained Zaphod. "I discovered it had an
emergency back-up personality that I thought might work out
better."
"Now this is going to be your first day out on a strange new
planet," continued Eddie's new voice, "so I want you all wrapped
up snug and warm, and no playing with any naughty bug-eyed
monsters."
Zaphod tapped impatiently on the hatch.
"I'm sorry," he said, "I think we might be better off with a
slide rule."
"Right!" snapped the computer. "Who said that?"
"Will you open the exit hatch please, computer?" said Zaphod
trying not to get angry.
"Not until whoever said that owns up," urged the computer,
stamping a few synapses closed.
"Oh God," muttered Ford, slumped against a bulkhead and started
to count to ten. He was desperately worried that one day
sentinent life forms would forget how to do this. Only by
counting could humans demonstrate their independence of
computers.
"Come on," said Eddie sternly.
"Computer ..." began Zaphod ...
"I'm waiting," interrupted Eddie. "I can wait all day if
necessary ..."
"Computer ..." said Zaphod again, who had been trying to think of
some subtle piece of reasoning to put the computer down with, and
had decided not to bother competing with it on its own ground,
"if you don't open that exit hatch this moment I shall zap
straight off to your major data banks and reprogram you with a
very large axe, got that?"
Eddie, shocked, paused and considered this.
Ford carried on counting quietly. This is about the most
aggressive thing you can do to a computer, the equivalent of
going up to a human being and saying Blood ... blood ... blood
... blood ...
Finally Eddie said quietly, "I can see this relationship is
something we're all going to have to work at," and the hatchway
opened.
An icy wind ripped into them, they hugged themselves warmly and
stepped down the ramp on to the barren dust of Magrathea.
"It'll all end in tears, I know it," shouted Eddie after them and
closed the hatchway again.
A few minutes later he opened and closed the hatchway again in
response to a command that caught him entirely by surprise.
Five figures wandered slowly over the blighted land. Bits of it
were dullish grey, bits of it dullish brown, the rest of it
rather less interesting to look at. It was like a dried-out
marsh, now barren of all vegetation and covered with a layer of
dust about an inch thick. It was very cold.
Zaphod was clearly rather depressed about it. He stalked off by
himself and was soon lost to sight behind a slight rise in the
ground.
The wind stung Arthur's eyes and ears, and the stale thin air
clasped his throat. However, the thing stung most was his mind.
"It's fantastic ..." he said, and his own voice rattled his ears.
Sound carried badly in this thin atmosphere.
"Desolate hole if you ask me," said Ford. "I could have more fun
in a cat litter." He felt a mounting irritation. Of all the
planets in all the star systems of all the Galaxy - didn't he
just have to turn up at a dump like this after fifteen years of
being a castaway? Not even a hot dog stand in evidence. He
stooped down and picked up a cold clot of earth, but there was
nothing underneath it worth crossing thousands of light years to
look at.
"No," insisted Arthur, "don't you understand, this is the first
time I've actually stood on the surface of another planet ... a
whole alien world ...! Pity it's such a dump though."
Trillian hugged herself, shivered and frowned. She could have
sworn she saw a slight and unexpected movement out of the corner
of her eye, but when she glanced in that direction all she could
see was the ship, still and silent, a hundred yards or so behind
them.
She was relieved when a second or so later they caught sight of
Zaphod standing on top of the ridge of ground and waving to them
to come and join him.
He seemed to be excited, but they couldn't clearly hear what he
was saying because of the thinnish atmosphere and the wind.
As they approached the ridge of higher ground they became aware
that it seemed to be circular - a crater about a hundred and
fifty yards wide. Round the outside of the crater the sloping
ground was spattered with black and red lumps. They stopped and
looked at a piece. It was wet. It was rubbery.
With horror they suddenly realized that it was fresh whalemeat.
At the top of the crater's lip they met Zaphod.
"Look," he said, pointing into the crater.
In the centre lay the exploded carcass of a lonely sperm whale
that hadn't lived long enough to be disappointed with its lot.
The silence was only disturbed by the slight involuntary spasms
of Trillian's throat.
"I suppose there's no point in trying to bury it?" murmured
Arthur, and then wished he hadn't.
"Come," said Zaphod and started back down into the crater.
"What, down there?" said Trillian with severe distaste.
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "come on, I've got something to show you."
"We can see it," said Trillian.
"Not that," said Zaphod, "something else. Come on."
They all hesitated.
"Come on," insisted Zaphod, "I've found a way in."
"In?" said Arthur in horror.
"Into the interior of the planet! An underground passage. The
force of the whale's impact cracked it open, and that's where we
have to go. Where no man has trod these five million years, into
the very depths of time itself ..."
Marvin started his ironical humming again.
Zaphod hit him and he shut up.
With little shudders of disgust they all followed Zaphod down the
incline into the crater, trying very hard not to look at its
unfortunate creator.
"Life," said Marvin dolefully, "loathe it or ignore it, you can't
like it."
The ground had caved in where the whale had hit it revealing a
network of galleries and passages, now largely obstructed by
collapsed rubble and entrails. Zaphod had made a start clearing a
way into one of them, but Marvin was able to do it rather faster.
Dank air wafted out of its dark recesses, and as Zaphod shone a
torch into it, little was visible in the dusty gloom.
"According to the legends," he said, "the Magratheans lived most
of their lives underground."
"Why's that?" said Arthur. "Did the surface become too polluted
or overpopulated?"
"No, I don't think so," said Zaphod. "I think they just didn't
like it very much."
"Are you sure you know what you're doing?" said Trillian peering
nervously into the darkness. "We've been attacked once already
you know."
"Look kid, I promise you the live population of this planet is
nil plus the four of us, so come on, let's get on in there. Er,
hey Earthman ..."
"Arthur," said Arthur.
"Yeah could you just sort of keep this robot with you and guard
this end of the passageway. OK?"
"Guard?" said Arthur. "What from? You just said there's no one
here."
"Yeah, well, just for safety, OK?" said Zaphod.
"Whose? Yours or mine?"
"Good lad. OK, here we go."
Zaphod scrambled down into the passage, followed by Trillian and
Ford.
"Well I hope you all have a really miserable time," complained
Arthur.
"Don't worry," Marvin assured him, "they will."
In a few seconds they had disappeared from view.
Arthur stamped around in a huff, and then decided that a whale's
graveyard is not on the whole a good place to stamp around in.
Marvin eyed him balefully for a moment, and then turned himself
off.
Zaphod marched quickly down the passageway, nervous as hell, but
trying to hide it by striding purposefully. He flung the torch
beam around. The walls were covered in dark tiles and were cold
to the touch, the air thick with decay.
"There, what did I tell you?" he said. "An inhabited planet.
Magrathea," and he strode on through the dirt and debris that
littered the tile floor.
Trillian was reminded unavoidably of the London Underground,
though it was less thoroughly squalid.
At intervals along the walls the tiles gave way to large mosaics
- simple angular patterns in bright colours. Trillian stopped and
studied one of them but could not interpret any sense in them.
She called to Zaphod.
"Hey, have you any idea what these strange symbols are?"
"I think they're just strange symbols of some kind," said Zaphod,
hardly glancing back.
Trillian shrugged and hurried after him.
From time to time a doorway led either to the left or right into
smallish chambers which Ford discovered to be full of derelict
computer equipment. He dragged Zaphod into one to have a look.
Trillian followed.
"Look," said Ford, "you reckon this is Magrathea ..."
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "and we heard the voice, right?"
"OK, so I've bought the fact that it's Magrathea - for the
moment. What you have so far said nothing about is how in the
Galaxy you found it. You didn't just look it up in a star atlas,
that's for sure."
"Research. Government archives. Detective work. Few lucky
guesses. Easy."
"And then you stole the Heart of Gold to come and look for it
with?"
"I stole it to look for a lot of things."
"A lot of things?" said Ford in surprise. "Like what?"
"I don't know."
"What?"
"I don't know what I'm looking for."
"Why not?"
"Because ... because ... I think it might be because if I knew I
wouldn't be able to look for them."
"What, are you crazy?"
"It's a possibility I haven't ruled out yet," said Zaphod
quietly. "I only know as much about myself as my mind can work
out under its current conditions. And its current conditions are
not good."
For a long time nobody said anything as Ford gazed at Zaphod with
a mind suddenly full of worry.
"Listen old friend, if you want to ..." started Ford eventually.
"No, wait ... I'll tell you something," said Zaphod. "I freewheel
a lot. I get an idea to do something, and, hey, why not, I do it.
I reckon I'll become President of the Galaxy, and it just
happens, it's easy. I decide to steal this ship. I decide to look
for Magrathea, and it all just happens. Yeah, I work out how it
can best be done, right, but it always works out. It's like
having a Galacticredit card which keeps on working though you
never send off the cheques. And then whenever I stop and think -
why did I want to do something? - how did I work out how to do
it? - I get a very strong desire just to stop thinking about it.
Like I have now. It's a big effort to talk about it."
Zaphod paused for a while. For a while there was silence. Then he
frowned and said, "Last night I was worrying about this again.
About the fact that part of my mind just didn't seem to work
properly. Then it occurred to me that the way it seemed was that
someone else was using my mind to have good ideas with, without
telling me about it. I put the two ideas together and decided
that maybe that somebody had locked off part of my mind for that
purpose, which was why I couldn't use it. I wondered if there was
a way I could check.
"I went to the ship's medical bay and plugged myself into the
encephelographic screen. I went through every major screening
test on both my heads - all the tests I had to go through under
government medical officers before my nomination for Presidency
could be properly ratified. They showed up nothing. Nothing
unexpected at least. They showed that I was clever, imaginative,
irresponsible, untrustworthy, extrovert, nothing you couldn't
have guessed. And no other anomalies. So I started inventing
further tests, completely at random. Nothing. Then I tried
superimposing the results from one head on top of the results
from the other head. Still nothing. Finally I got silly, because
I'd given it all up as nothing more than an attack of paranoia.
Last thing I did before I packed it in was take the superimposed
picture and look at it through a green filter. You remember I was
always superstitious about the color green when I was a kid? I
always wanted to be a pilot on one of the trading scouts?"
Ford nodded.
"And there it was," said Zaphod, "clear as day. A whole section
in the middle of both brains that related only to each other and
not to anything else around them. Some bastard had cauterized all
the synapses and electronically traumatised those two lumps of
cerebellum."
Ford stared at him, aghast. Trillian had turned white.
"Somebody did that to you?" whispered Ford.
"Yeah."
"But have you any idea who? Or why?"
"Why? I can only guess. But I do know who the bastard was."
"You know? How do you know?"
"Because they left their initials burnt into the cauterized
synapses. They left them there for me to see."
Ford stared at him in horror and felt his skin begin to crawl.
"Initials? Burnt into your brain?"
"Yeah."
"Well, what were they, for God's sake?"
Zaphod looked at him in silence again for a moment. Then he
looked away.
"Z.B.," he said.
At that moment a steel shutter slammed down behind them and gas
started to pour into the chamber.
"I'll tell you about it later," choked Zaphod as all three passed
out.
On the surface of Magrathea Arthur wandered about moodily.
Ford had thoughtfully left him his copy of The Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy to while away the time with. He pushed a few
buttons at random.
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a very unevenly edited
book and contains many passages that simply seemed to its editors
like a good idea at the time.
One of these (the one Arthur now came across) supposedly relates
the experiences of one Veet Voojagig, a quiet young student at
the University of Maximegalon, who pursued a brilliant academic
career studying ancient philology, transformational ethics and
the wave harmonic theory of historical perception, and then,
after a night of drinking Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with
Zaphod Beeblebrox, became increasingly obsessed with the problem
of what had happened to all the biros he'd bought over the past
few years.
There followed a long period of painstaking research during which
he visited all the major centres of biro loss throughout the
galaxy and eventually came up with a quaint little theory which
quite caught the public imagination at the time. Somewhere in the
cosmos, he said, along with all the planets inhabited by
humanoids, reptiloids, fishoids, walking treeoids and
superintelligent shades of the colour blue, there was also a
planet entirely given over to biro life forms. And it was to this
planet that unattended biros would make their way, slipping away
quietly through wormholes in space to a world where they knew
they could enjoy a uniquely biroid lifestyle, responding to
highly biro-oriented stimuli, and generally leading the biro
equivalent of the good life.
And as theories go this was all very fine and pleasant until Veet
Voojagig suddenly claimed to have found this planet, and to have
worked there for a while driving a limousine for a family of
cheap green retractables, whereupon he was taken away, locked up,
wrote a book, and was finally sent into tax exile, which is the
usual fate reserved for those who are determined to make a fool
of themselves in public.
When one day an expedition was sent to the spatial coordinates
that Voojagig had claimed for this planet they discovered only a
small asteroid inhabited by a solitary old man who claimed
repeatedly that nothing was true, though he was later discovered
to be lying.
There did, however, remain the question of both the mysterious
, Altairan dollars paid yearly into his Brantisvogan bank
account, and of course Zaphod Beeblebrox's highly profitable
second-hand biro business.
Arthur read this, and put the book down.
The robot still sat there, completely inert.
Arthur got up and walked to the top of the crater. He walked
around the crater. He watched two suns set magnificently over
Magrathea.
He went back down into the crater. He woke the robot up because
even a manically depressed robot is better to talk to than
nobody.
"Night's falling," he said. "Look robot, the stars are coming
out."
From the heart of a dark nebula it is possible to see very few
stars, and only very faintly, but they were there to be seen.
The robot obediently looked at them, then looked back.
"I know," he said. "Wretched isn't it?"
"But that sunset! I've never seen anything like it in my wildest
dreams ... the two suns! It was like mountains of fire boiling
into space."
"I've seen it," said Marvin. "It's rubbish."
"We only ever had the one sun at home," persevered Arthur, "I
came from a planet called Earth you know."
"I know," said Marvin, "you keep going on about it. It sounds
awful."
"Ah no, it was a beautiful place."
"Did it have oceans?"
"Oh yes," said Arthur with a sigh, "great wide rolling blue
oceans ..."
"Can't bear oceans," said Marvin.
"Tell me," inquired Arthur, "do you get on well with other
robots?"
"Hate them," said Marvin. "Where are you going?"
Arthur couldn't bear any more. He had got up again.
"I think I'll just take another walk," he said.
"Don't blame you," said Marvin and counted five hundred and
ninety-seven thousand million sheep before falling asleep again a
second later.
Arthur slapped his arms about himself to try and get his
circulation a little more enthusiastic about its job. He trudged
back up the wall of the crater.
Because the atmosphere was so thin and because there was no moon,
nightfall was very rapid and it was by now very dark. Because of
this, Arthur practically walked into the old man before he
noticed him.
He was standing with his back to Arthur watching the very last
glimmers of light sink into blackness behind the horizon. He was
tallish, elderly and dressed in a single long grey robe. When he
turned his face was thin and distinguished, careworn but not
unkind, the sort of face you would happily bank with. But he
didn't turn yet, not even to react to Arthur's yelp of surprise.
Eventually the last rays of the sun had vanished completely, and
he turned. His face was still illuminated from somewhere, and
when Arthur looked for the source of the light he saw that a few
yards away stood a small craft of some kind - a small hovercraft,
Arthur guessed. It shed a dim pool of light around it.
The man looked at Arthur, sadly it seemed.
"You choose a cold night to visit our dead planet," he said.
"Who ... who are you?" stammered Arthur.
The man looked away. Again a kind of sadness seemed to cross his
face.
"My name is not important," he said.
He seemed to have something on his mind. Conversation was clearly
something he felt he didn't have to rush at. Arthur felt awkward.
"I ... er ... you startled me ..." he said, lamely.
The man looked round to him again and slightly raised his
eyebrows.
"Hmmmm?" he said.
"I said you startled me."
"Do not be alarmed, I will not harm you."
Arthur frowned at him. "But you shot at us! There were missiles
..." he said.
The man chuckled slightly.
"An automatic system," he said and gave a small sigh. "Ancient
computers ranged in the bowels of the planet tick away the dark
millennia, and the ages hang heavy on their dusty data banks. I
think they take the occasional pot shot to relieve the monotony."
He looked gravely at Arthur and said, "I'm a great fan of science
you know."
"Oh ... er, really?" said Arthur, who was beginning to find the
man's curious, kindly manner disconcerting.
"Oh, yes," said the old man, and simply stopped talking again.
"Ah," said Arthur, "er ..." He had an odd felling of being like a
man in the act of adultery who is surprised when the woman's
husband wanders into the room, changes his trousers, passes a few
idle remarks about the weather and leaves again.
"You seem ill at ease," said the old man with polite concern.
"Er, no ... well, yes. Actually you see, we weren't really
expecting to find anybody about in fact. I sort of gathered that
you were all dead or something ..."
"Dead?" said the old man. "Good gracious no, we have but slept."
"Slept?" said Arthur incredulously.
"Yes, through the economic recession you see," said the old man,
apparently unconcerned about whether Arthur understood a word
he was talking about or not.
"Er, economic recession?"
"Well you see, five million years ago the Galactic economy
collapsed, and seeing that custom-made planets are something of a
luxury commodity you see ..."
He paused and looked at Arthur.
"You know we built planets do you?" he asked solemnly.
"Well yes," said Arthur, "I'd sort of gathered ..."
"Fascinating trade," said the old man, and a wistful look came
into his eyes, "doing the coastlines was always my favourite.
Used to have endless fun doing the little bits in fjords ... so
anyway," he said trying to find his thread again, "the recession
came and we decided it would save us a lot of bother if we just
slept through it. So we programmed the computers to revive us
when it was all over."
The man stifled a very slight yawn and continued.
"The computers were index linked to the Galactic stock market
prices you see, so that we'd all be revived when everybody else
had rebuilt the economy enough to afford our rather expensive
services."
Arthur, a regular Guardian reader, was deeply shocked at this.
"That's a pretty unpleasant way to behave isn't it?"
"Is it?" asked the old man mildly. "I'm sorry, I'm a bit out of
touch."
He pointed down into the crater.
"Is that robot yours?" he said.
"No," came a thin metallic voice from the crater, "I'm mine."
"If you'd call it a robot," muttered Arthur. "It's more a sort of
electronic sulking machine."
"Bring it," said the old man. Arthur was quite surprised to hear
a note of decision suddenly present in the old man's voice. He
called to Marvin who crawled up the slope making a big show of
being lame, which he wasn't.
"On second thoughts," said the old man, "leave it here. You must
come with me. Great things are afoot." He turned towards his
craft which, though no apparent signal had been given, now
drifted quietly towards them through the dark.
Arthur looked down at Marvin, who now made an equally big show of
turning round laboriously and trudging off down into the crater
again muttering sour nothings to himself.
"Come," called the old man, "come now or you will be late."
"Late?" said Arthur. "What for?"
"What is your name, human?"
"Dent. Arthur Dent," said Arthur.
"Late, as in the late Dentarthurdent," said the old man, sternly.
"It's a sort of threat you see." Another wistful look came into
his tired old eyes. "I've never been very good at them myself,
but I'm told they can be very effective."
Arthur blinked at him.
"What an extraordinary person," he muttered to himself.
"I beg your pardon?" said the old man.
"Oh nothing, I'm sorry," said Arthur in embarrassment. "Alright,
where do we go?"
"In my aircar," said the old man motioning Arthur to get into the
craft which had settled silently next to them. "We are going deep
into the bowels of the planet where even now our race is being
revived from its five-million-year slumber. Magrathea awakes."
Arthur shivered involuntarily as he seated himself next to the
old man. The strangeness of it, the silent bobbing movement of
the craft as it soared into the night sky quite unsettled him.
He looked at the old man, his face illuminated by the dull glow
of tiny lights on the instrument panel.
"Excuse me," he said to him, "what is your name by the way?"
"My name?" said the old man, and the same distant sadness came
into his face again. He paused. "My name," he said, "... is
Slartibartfast."
Arthur practically choked.
"I beg your pardon?" he spluttered.
"Slartibartfast," repeated the old man quietly.
"Slartibartfast?"
The old man looked at him gravely.
"I said it wasn't important," he said.
The aircar sailed through the night.
It is an important and popular fact that things are not always
what they seem. For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always
assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had
achieved so much - the wheel, New York, wars and so on - whilst
all the dolphins had ever done was muck about in the water having
a good time. But conversely, the dolphins had always believed
that they were far more intelligent than man - for precisely the
same reasons.
Curiously enough, the dolphins had long known of the impending
destruction of the planet Earth and had made many attempts to
alert mankind of the danger; but most of their communications
were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or
whistle for tidbits, so they eventually gave up and left the
Earth by their own means shortly before the Vogons arrived.
The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a
surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards-
somersault through a hoop whilst whistling the "Star Sprangled
Banner", but in fact the message was this: So long and thanks for
all the fish.
In fact there was only one species on the planet more intelligent
than dolphins, and they spent a lot of their time in behavioural
research laboratories running round inside wheels and conducting
frighteningly elegant and subtle experiments on man. 
The fact that once again man completely misinterpreted this 
relationship was entirely according to these creatures' plans.
Silently the aircar coasted through the cold darkness, a single
soft glow of light that was utterly alone in the deep Magrathean
night. It sped swiftly. Arthur's companion seemed sunk in his own
thoughts, and when Arthur tried on a couple of occasions to
engage him in conversation again he would simply reply by asking
if he was comfortable enough, and then left it at that.
Arthur tried to gauge the speed at which they were travelling,
but the blackness outside was absolute and he was denied any
reference points. The sense of motion was so soft and slight he
could almost believe they were hardly moving at all.
Then a tiny glow of light appeared in the far distance and within
seconds had grown so much in size that Arthur realized it was
travelling towards them at a colossal speed, and he tried to make
out what sort of craft it might be. He peered at it, but was
unable to discern any clear shape, and suddenly gasped in alarm
as the aircraft dipped sharply and headed downwards in what
seemed certain to be a collision course. Their relative velocity
seemed unbelievable, and Arthur had hardly time to draw breath
before it was all over. The next thing he was aware of was an
insane silver blur that seemed to surround him. He twisted his
head sharply round and saw a small black point dwindling rapidly
in the distance behind them, and it took him several seconds to
realize what had happened.
They had plunged into a tunnel in the ground. The colossal speed
had been their own relative to the glow of light which was a
stationary hole in the ground, the mouth of the tunnel. The
insane blur of silver was the circular wall of the tunnel down
which they were shooting, apparently at several hundred miles an
hour.
He closed his eyes in terror.
After a length of time which he made no attempt to judge, he
sensed a slight subsidence in their speed and some while later
became aware that they were gradually gliding to a gentle halt.
He opened his eyes again. They were still in the silver tunnel,
threading and weaving their way through what appeared to be a
crisscross warren of converging tunnels. When they finally
stopped it was in a small chamber of curved steel. Several
tunnels also had their terminus here, and at the farther end of
the chamber Arthur could see a large circle of dim irritating
light. It was irritating because it played tricks with the eyes,
it was impossible to focus on it properly or tell how near or far
it was. Arthur guessed (quite wrongly) that it might be ultra
violet.
Slartibartfast turned and regarded Arthur with his solemn old
eyes.
"Earthman," he said, "we are now deep in the heart of Magrathea."
"How did you know I was an Earthman?" demanded Arthur.
"These things will become clear to you," said the old man gently,
"at least," he added with slight doubt in his voice, "clearer
than they are at the moment."
He continued: "I should warn you that the chamber we are about to
pass into does not literally exist within our planet. It is a
little too ... large. We are about to pass through a gateway into
a vast tract of hyperspace. It may disturb you."
Arthur made nervous noises.
Slartibartfast touched a button and added, not entirely
reassuringly. "It scares the willies out of me. Hold tight."
The car shot forward straight into the circle of light, and
suddenly Arthur had a fairly clear idea of what infinity looked
like.
It wasn't infinity in fact. Infinity itself looks flat and
uninteresting. Looking up into the night sky is looking into
infinity - distance is incomprehensible and therefore
meaningless. The chamber into which the aircar emerged was
anything but infinite, it was just very very big, so that it gave
the impression of infinity far better than infinity itself.
Arthur's senses bobbed and span, as, travelling at the immense
speed he knew the aircar attained, they climbed slowly through
the open air leaving the gateway through which they had passed an
invisible pinprick in the shimmering wall behind them.
The wall.
The wall defied the imagination - seduced it and defeated it. The
wall was so paralysingly vast and sheer that its top, bottom and
sides passed away beyond the reach of sight. The mere shock of
vertigo could kill a man.
The wall appeared perfectly flat. It would take the finest laser
measuring equipment to detect that as it climbed, apparently to
infinity, as it dropped dizzily away, as it planed out to either
side, it also curved. It met itself again thirteen light seconds
away. In other words the wall formed the inside of a hollow
sphere, a sphere over three million miles across and flooded with
unimaginable light.
"Welcome," said Slartibartfast as the tiny speck that was the
aircar, travelling now at three times the speed of sound, crept
imperceptibly forward into the mindboggling space, "welcome," he
said, "to our factory floor."
Arthur stared about him in a kind of wonderful horror. Ranged
away before them, at distances he could neither judge nor even
guess at, were a series of curious suspensions, delicate
traceries of metal and light hung about shadowy spherical shapes
that hung in the space.
"This," said Slartibartfast, "is where we make most of our
planets you see."
"You mean," said Arthur, trying to form the words, "you mean
you're starting it all up again now?"
"No no, good heavens no," exclaimed the old man, "no, the Galaxy
isn't nearly rich enough to support us yet. No, we've been
awakened to perform just one extraordinary commission for very
... special clients from another dimension. It may interest you
... there in the distance in front of us."
Arthur followed the old man's finger, till he was able to pick
out the floating structure he was pointing out. It was indeed the
only one of the many structures that betrayed any sign of
activity about it, though this was more a sublimal impression
than anything one could put one's finger on.
At the moment however a flash of light arced through the
structure and revealed in stark relief the patterns that were
formed on the dark sphere within. Patterns that Arthur knew,
rough blobby shapes that were as familiar to him as the shapes of
words, part of the furniture of his mind. For a few seconds he
sat in stunned silence as the images rushed around his mind and
tried to find somewhere to settle down and make sense.
Part of his brain told him that he knew perfectly well what he
was looking at and what the shapes represented whilst another
quite sensibly refused to countenance the idea and abdicated
responsibility for any further thinking in that direction.
The flash came again, and this time there could be no doubt.
"The Earth ..." whispered Arthur.
"Well, the Earth Mark Two in fact," said Slartibartfast
cheery. "We're making a copy from our original blueprints."
There was a pause.
"Are you trying to tell me," said Arthur, slowly and with
control, "that you originally ... made the Earth?"
"Oh yes," said Slartibartfast. "Did you ever go to a place ... I
think it was called Norway?"
"No," said Arthur, "no, I didn't."
"Pity," said Slartibartfast, "that was one of mine. Won an award
you know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was most upset to hear about
its destruction."
"You were upset!"
"Yes. Five minutes later and it wouldn't have mattered so much.
It was a quite shocking cock-up."
"Huh?" said Arthur.
"The mice were furious."
"The mice were furious?"
"Oh yes," said the old man mildly.
"Yes well so I expect were the dogs and cats and duckbilled
platypuses, but ..."
"Ah, but they hadn't paid for it you see, had they?"
"Look," said Arthur, "would it save you a lot of time if I just
gave up and went mad now?"
For a while the aircar flew on in awkward silence. Then the old
man tried patiently to explain.
"Earthman, the planet you lived on was commissioned, paid for,
and run by mice. It was destroyed five minutes before the
completion of the purpose for which it was built, and we've got
to build another one."
Only one word registered with Arthur.
"Mice?" he said.
"Indeed Earthman."
"Look, sorry - are we talking about the little white furry things
with the cheese fixation and women standing on tables screaming
in early sixties sit coms?"
Slartibartfast coughed politely.
"Earthman," he said, "it is sometimes hard to follow your mode of
speech. Remember I have been asleep inside this planet of
Magrathea for five million years and know little of these early
sixties sit coms of which you speak. These creatures you call
mice, you see, they are not quite as they appear. They are merely
the protrusion into our dimension of vast hyperintelligent pan-
dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese and the
squeaking is just a front."
The old man paused, and with a sympathetic frown continued.
"They've been experimenting on you I'm afraid."
Arthur thought about this for a second, and then his face
cleared.
"Ah no," he said, "I see the source of the misunderstanding now.
No, look you see, what happened was that we used to do
experiments on them. They were often used in behavioural
research, Pavlov and all that sort of stuff. So what happened was
hat the mice would be set all sorts of tests, learning to ring
bells, run around mazes and things so that the whole nature of
the learning process could be examined. From our observations of
their behaviour we were able to learn all sorts of things about
our own ..."
Arthur's voice tailed off.
"Such subtlety ..." said Slartibartfast, "one has to admire it."
"What?" said Arthur.
"How better to disguise their real natures, and how better to
guide your thinking. Suddenly running down a maze the wrong way,
eating the wrong bit of cheese, unexpectedly dropping dead of
myxomatosis, - if it's finely calculated the cumulative effect is
enormous."
He paused for effect.
"You see, Earthman, they really are particularly clever
hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings. Your planet and people
have formed the matrix of an organic computer running a ten-
million-year research programme ...
"Let me tell you the whole story. It'll take a little time."
"Time," said Arthur weakly, "is not currently one of my
problems."
There are of course many problems connected with life, of which
some of the most popular are Why are people born? Why do they
die? Why do they want to spend so much of the intervening time
wearing digital watches?
Many many millions of years ago a race of hyperintelligent pan-
dimensional beings (whose physical manifestation in their own
pan-dimensional universe is not dissimilar to our own) got so fed
up with the constant bickering about the meaning of life which
used to interrupt their favourite pastime of Brockian Ultra
Cricket (a curious game which involved suddenly hitting people
for no readily apparent reason and then running away) that they
decided to sit down and solve their problems once and for all.
And to this end they built themselves a stupendous super computer
which was so amazingly intelligent that even before the data
banks had been connected up it had started from I think therefore
I am and got as far as the existence of rice pudding and income
tax before anyone managed to turn it off.
It was the size of a small city.
Its main console was installed in a specially designed executive
office, mounted on an enormous executive desk of finest
ultramahagony topped with rich ultrared leather. The dark
carpeting was discreetly sumptuous, exotic pot plants and
tastefully engraved prints of the principal computer programmers
and their families were deployed liberally about the room, and
stately windows looked out upon a tree-lined public square.
On the day of the Great On-Turning two soberly dressed
programmers with brief cases arrived and were shown discreetly
into the office. They were aware that this day they would
represent their entire race in its greatest moment, but they
conducted themselves calmly and quietly as they seated themselves
deferentially before the desk, opened their brief cases and took
out their leather-bound notebooks.
Their names were Lunkwill and Fook.
For a few moments they sat in respectful silence, then, after
exchanging a quiet glance with Fook, Lunkwill leaned forward and
touched a small black panel.
The subtlest of hums indicated that the massive computer was now
in total active mode. After a pause it spoke to them in a voice
rich resonant and deep.
It said: "What is this great task for which I, Deep Thought, the
second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space have
been called into existence?"
Lunkwill and Fook glanced at each other in surprise.
 "Your task, O Computer ..." began Fook.
"No, wait a minute, this isn't right," said Lunkwill, worried.
"We distinctly designed this computer to be the greatest one ever
and we're not making do with second best. Deep Thought," he
addressed the computer, "are you not as we designed you to be,
the greatest most powerful computer in all time?"
"I described myself as the second greatest," intoned Deep
Thought, "and such I am."
Another worried look passed between the two programmers. Lunkwill
cleared his throat.
"There must be some mistake," he said, "are you not a greatest
computer than the Milliard Gargantubrain which can count all the
atoms in a star in a millisecond?"
"The Milliard Gargantubrain?" said Deep Thought with unconcealed
contempt. "A mere abacus - mention it not."
"And are you not," said Fook leaning anxiously forward, "a
greater analyst than the Googleplex Star Thinker in the Seventh
Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory
of every single dust particle throughout a five-week Dangrabad
Beta sand blizzard?"
"A five-week sand blizzard?" said Deep Thought haughtily. "You
ask this of me who have contemplated the very vectors of the
atoms in the Big Bang itself? Molest me not with this pocket
calculator stuff."
The two programmers sat in uncomfortable silence for a moment.
Then Lunkwill leaned forward again.
"But are you not," he said, "a more fiendish disputant than the
Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler of Ciceronicus ,
the Magic and Indefatigable?"
"The Great Hyperlobic Omni-Cognate Neutron Wrangler," said Deep
Thought thoroughly rolling the r's, "could talk all four legs off
an Arcturan MegaDonkey - but only I could persuade it to go for a
walk afterwards."
"Then what," asked Fook, "is the problem?"
"There is no problem," said Deep Thought with magnificent ringing
tones. "I am simply the second greatest computer in the Universe
of Space and Time."
"But the second?" insisted Lunkwill. "Why do you keep saying the
second? You're surely not thinking of the Multicorticoid
Perspicutron Titan Muller are you? Or the Pondermatic? Or the
..."
Contemptuous lights flashed across the computer's console.
"I spare not a single unit of thought on these cybernetic
simpletons!" he boomed. "I speak of none but the computer that is
to come after me!"
Fook was losing patience. He pushed his notebook aside and
muttered, "I think this is getting needlessly messianic."
"You know nothing of future time," pronounced Deep Thought, "and
yet in my teeming circuitry I can navigate the infinite delta
streams of future probability and see that there must one day
come a computer whose merest operational parameters I am not
worthy to calculate, but which it will be my fate eventually to
design."
Fook sighed heavily and glanced across to Lunkwill.
"Can we get on and ask the question?" he said.
Lunkwill motioned him to wait.
"What computer is this of which you speak?" he asked.
"I will speak of it no further in this present time," said Deep
Thought. "Now. Ask what else of me you will that I may function.
Speak."
They shrugged at each other. Fook composed himself.
"O Deep Thought Computer," he said, "the task we have designed
you to perform is this. We want you to tell us ..." he paused,
"... the Answer!"
"The answer?" said Deep Thought. "The answer to what?"
"Life!" urged Fook.
"The Universe!" said Lunkwill.
"Everything!" they said in chorus.
Deep Thought paused for a moment's reflection.
"Tricky," he said finally.
"But can you do it?"
Again, a significant pause.
"Yes," said Deep Thought, "I can do it."
"There is an answer?" said Fook with breathless excitement."
"A simple answer?" added Lunkwill.
"Yes," said Deep Thought. "Life, the Universe, and Everything.
There is an answer. But," he added, "I'll have to think about
it."
A sudden commotion destroyed the moment: the door flew open and
two angry men wearing the coarse faded-blue robes and belts of
the Cruxwan University burst into the room, thrusting aside the
ineffectual flunkies who tried to bar their way.
"We demand admission!" shouted the younger of the two men
elbowing a pretty young secretary in the throat.
"Come on," shouted the older one, "you can't keep us out!" He
pushed a junior programmer back through the door.
"We demand that you can't keep us out!" bawled the younger one,
though he was now firmly inside the room and no further attempts
were being made to stop him.
"Who are you?" said Lunkwill, rising angrily from his seat. "What
do you want?"
"I am Majikthise!" announced the older one.
"And I demand that I am Vroomfondel!" shouted the younger one.
Majikthise turned on Vroomfondel. "It's alright," he explained
angrily, "you don't need to demand that."
"Alright!" bawled Vroomfondel banging on an nearby desk. "I am
Vroomfondel, and that is not a demand, that is a solid fact! What
we demand is solid facts!"
"No we don't!" exclaimed Majikthise in irritation. "That is
precisely what we don't demand!"
Scarcely pausing for breath, Vroomfondel shouted, "We don't
demand solid facts! What we demand is a total absence of solid
facts. I demand that I may or may not be Vroomfondel!"
"But who the devil are you?" exclaimed an outraged Fook.
"We," said Majikthise, "are Philosophers."
"Though we may not be," said Vroomfondel waving a warning finger
at the programmers.
"Yes we are," insisted Majikthise. "We are quite definitely here
as representatives of the Amalgamated Union of Philosophers,
Sages, Luminaries and Other Thinking Persons, and we want this
machine off, and we want it off now!"
"What's the problem?" said Lunkwill.
"I'll tell you what the problem is mate," said Majikthise,
"demarcation, that's the problem!"
"We demand," yelled Vroomfondel, "that demarcation may or may not
be the problem!"
"You just let the machines get on with the adding up," warned
Majikthise, "and we'll take care of the eternal verities thank
you very much. You want to check your legal position you do mate.
Under law the Quest for Ultimate Truth is quite clearly the
inalienable prerogative of your working thinkers. Any bloody
machine goes and actually finds it and we're straight out of a
job aren't we? I mean what's the use of our sitting up half the
night arguing that there may or may not be a God if this machine
only goes and gives us his bleeding phone number the next
morning?"
"That's right!" shouted Vroomfondel, "we demand rigidly defined
areas of doubt and uncertainty!"
Suddenly a stentorian voice boomed across the room.
"Might I make an observation at this point?" inquired Deep
Thought.
"We'll go on strike!" yelled Vroomfondel.
"That's right!" agreed Majikthise. "You'll have a national
Philosopher's strike on your hands!"
The hum level in the room suddenly increased as several ancillary
bass driver units, mounted in sedately carved and varnished
cabinet speakers around the room, cut in to give Deep Thought's
voice a little more power.
"All I wanted to say," bellowed the computer, "is that my
circuits are now irrevocably committed to calculating the answer
to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything -"
he paused and satisfied himself that he now had everyone's
attention, before continuing more quietly, "but the programme
will take me a little while to run."
Fook glanced impatiently at his watch.
"How long?" he said.
"Seven and a half million years," said Deep Thought.
Lunkwill and Fook blinked at each other.
"Seven and a half million years ...!" they cried in chorus.
"Yes," declaimed Deep Thought, "I said I'd have to think about
it, didn't I? And it occurs to me that running a programme like
this is bound to create an enormous amount of popular publicity
for the whole area of philosophy in general. Everyone's going to
have their own theories about what answer I'm eventually to come
up with, and who better to capitalize on that media market than
you yourself? So long as you can keep disagreeing with each other
violently enough and slagging each other off in the popular
press, you can keep yourself on the gravy train for life. How
does that sound?"
The two philosophers gaped at him.
"Bloody hell," said Majikthise, "now that is what I call
thinking. Here Vroomfondel, why do we never think of things like
that?"
"Dunno," said Vroomfondel in an awed whisper, "think our brains
must be too highly trained Majikthise."
So saying, they turned on their heels and walked out of the door
and into a lifestyle beyond their wildest dreams.
"Yes, very salutary," said Arthur, after Slartibartfast had
related the salient points of the story to him, "but I don't
understand what all this has got to do with the Earth and mice
and things."
"That is but the first half of the story Earthman," said the old
man. "If you would care to discover what happened seven and a
half millions later, on the great day of the Answer, allow me to
invite you to my study where you can experience the events
yourself on our Sens-O-Tape records. That is unless you would
care to take a quick stroll on the surface of New Earth. It's
only half completed I'm afraid - we haven't even finished burying
the artificial dinosaur skeletons in the crust yet, then we have
the Tertiary and Quarternary Periods of the Cenozoic Era to lay
down, and ..."
"No thank you," said Arthur, "it wouldn't be quite the same."
"No," said Slartibartfast, "it won't be," and he turned the
aircar round and headed back towards the mind-numbing wall.
Slartibartfast's study was a total mess, like the results of an
explosion in a public library. The old man frowned as they
stepped in.
"Terribly unfortunate," he said, "a diode blew in one of the
life-support computers. When we tried to revive our cleaning
staff we discovered they'd been dead for nearly thirty thousand
years. Who's going to clear away the bodies, that's what I want
to know. Look why don't you sit yourself down over there and let
me plug you in?"
He gestured Arthur towards a chair which looked as if it had been
made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus.
"It was made out of the rib cage of a stegosaurus," explained the
old man as he pottered about fishing bits of wire out from under
tottering piles of paper and drawing instruments. "Here," he
said, "hold these," and passed a couple of stripped wire end to
Arthur.
The instant he took hold of them a bird flew straight through
him.
He was suspended in mid-air and totally invisible to himself.
Beneath him was a pretty treelined city square, and all around it
as far as the eye could see were white concrete buildings of airy
spacious design but somewhat the worse for wear - many were
cracked and stained with rain. Today however the sun was shining,
a fresh breeze danced lightly through the trees, and the odd
sensation that all the buildings were quietly humming was
probably caused by the fact that the square and all the streets
around it were thronged with cheerful excited people. Somewhere a
band was playing, brightly coloured flags were fluttering in the
breeze and the spirit of carnival was in the air.
Arthur felt extraordinarily lonely stuck up in the air above it
all without so much as a body to his name, but before he had time
to reflect on this a voice rang out across the square and called
for everyone's attention.
A man standing on a brightly dressed dais before the building
which clearly dominated the square was addressing the crowd over
a Tannoy.
"O people waiting in the Shadow of Deep Thought!" he cried out.
"Honoured Descendants of Vroomfondel and Majikthise, the Greatest
and Most Truly Interesting Pundits the Universe has ever known
... The Time of Waiting is over!"
Wild cheers broke out amongst the crowd. Flags, streamers and
wolf whistles sailed through the air. The narrower streets looked
rather like centipedes rolled over on their backs and frantically
waving their legs in the air.
"Seven and a half million years our race has waited for this
Great and Hopefully Enlightening Day!" cried the cheer leader.
"The Day of the Answer!"
Hurrahs burst from the ecstatic crowd.
"Never again," cried the man, "never again will we wake up in the
morning and think Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Does it
really, cosmically speaking, matter if I don't get up and go to
work? For today we will finally learn once and for all the plain
and simple answer to all these nagging little problems of Life,
the Universe and Everything!"
As the crowd erupted once again, Arthur found himself gliding
through the air and down towards one of the large stately windows
on the first floor of the building behind the dais from which the
speaker was addressing the crowd.
He experienced a moment's panic as he sailed straight through
towards the window, which passed when a second or so later he
found he had gone right through the solid glass without
apparently touching it.
No one in the room remarked on his peculiar arrival, which is
hardly surprising as he wasn't there. He began to realize that
the whole experience was merely a recorded projection which
knocked six-track seventy-millimetre into a cocked hat.
The room was much as Slartibartfast had described it. In seven
and a half million years it had been well looked after and
cleaned regularly every century or so. The ultramahagony desk was
worn at the edges, the carpet a little faded now, but the large
computer terminal sat in sparkling glory on the desk's leather
top, as bright as if it had been constructed yesterday.
Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the terminal and
waited.
"The time is nearly upon us," said one, and Arthur was surprised
to see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man's
neck. The word was Loonquawl, and it flashed a couple of times
and the disappeared again. Before Arthur was able to assimilate
this the other man spoke and the word Phouchg appeared by his
neck.
"Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our ancestors set this
program in motion," the second man said, "and in all that time we
will be the first to hear the computer speak."
"An awesome prospect, Phouchg," agreed the first man, and Arthur
suddenly realized that he was watching a recording with
subtitles.
"We are the ones who will hear," said Phouchg, "the answer to the
great question of Life ...!"
"The Universe ...!" said Loonquawl.
"And Everything ...!"
"Shhh," said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, "I think Deep
Thought is preparing to speak!"
There was a moment's expectant pause whilst panels slowly came to
life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on and off
experimentally and settled down into a businesslike pattern. A
soft low hum came from the communication channel.
"Good morning," said Deep Thought at last.
"Er ... Good morning, O Deep Thought," said Loonquawl nervously,
"do you have ... er, that is ..."
"An answer for you?" interrupted Deep Thought majestically. "Yes.
I have."
The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been
in vain.
"There really is one?" breathed Phouchg.
"There really is one," confirmed Deep Thought.
"To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the Universe and
Everything?"
"Yes."
Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their lives had
been a preparation for it, they had been selected at birth as
those who would witness the answer, but even so they found
themselves gasping and squirming like excited children.
"And you're ready to give it to us?" urged Loonquawl.
"I am."
"Now?"
"Now," said Deep Thought.
They both licked their dry lips.
"Though I don't think," added Deep Thought, "that you're going to
like it."
"Doesn't matter!" said Phouchg. "We must know it! Now!"
"Now?" inquired Deep Thought.
"Yes! Now ..."
"Alright," said the computer and settled into silence again. The
two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.
"You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought.
"Tell us!"
"Alright," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the Great Question
..."
"Yes ...!"
"Of Life, the Universe and Everything ..." said Deep Thought.
"Yes ...!"
"Is ..." said Deep Thought, and paused.
"Yes ...!"
"Is ..."
"Yes ...!!!...?"
"Forty-two," said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.
It was a long time before anyone spoke.
Out of the corner of his eye Phouchg could see the sea of tense
expectant faces down in the square outside.
"We're going to get lynched aren't we?" he whispered.
"It was a tough assignment," said Deep Thought mildly.
"Forty-two!" yelled Loonquawl. "Is that all you've got to show
for seven and a half million years' work?"
"I checked it very thoroughly," said the computer, "and that
quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite
honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the
question is."
"But it was the Great Question! The Ultimate Question of Life,
the Universe and Everything!" howled Loonquawl.
"Yes," said Deep Thought with the air of one who suffers fools
gladly, "but what actually is it?"
A slow stupefied silence crept over the men as they stared at the
computer and then at each other.
"Well, you know, it's just Everything ... Everything ..." offered
Phouchg weakly.
"Exactly!" said Deep Thought. "So once you do know what the
question actually is, you'll know what the answer means."
"Oh terrific," muttered Phouchg flinging aside his notebook and
wiping away a tiny tear.
"Look, alright, alright," said Loonquawl, "can you just please
tell us the Question?"
"The Ultimate Question?"
"Yes!"
"Of Life, the Universe, and Everything?"
"Yes!"
Deep Thought pondered this for a moment.
"Tricky," he said.
"But can you do it?" cried Loonquawl.
Deep Thought pondered this for another long moment.
Finally: "No," he said firmly.
Both men collapsed on to their chairs in despair.
"But I'll tell you who can," said Deep Thought.
They both looked up sharply.
"Who?" "Tell us!"
Suddenly Arthur began to feel his apparently non-existent scalp
begin to crawl as he found himself moving slowly but inexorably
forward towards the console, but it was only a dramatic zoom on
the part of whoever had made the recording he assumed.
"I speak of none other than the computer that is to come after
me," intoned Deep Thought, his voice regaining its accustomed
declamatory tones. "A computer whose merest operational
parameters I am not worthy to calculate - and yet I will design
it for you. A computer which can calculate the Question to the
Ultimate Answer, a computer of such infinite and subtle
complexity that organic life itself shall form part of its
operational matrix. And you yourselves shall take on new forms
and go down into the computer to navigate its ten-million-year
program! Yes! I shall design this computer for you. And I shall
name it also unto you. And it shall be called ... The Earth."
Phouchg gaped at Deep Thought.
"What a dull name," he said and great incisions appeared down the
length of his body. Loonquawl too suddenly sustained horrific
gashed from nowhere. The Computer console blotched and cracked,
the walls flickered and crumbled and the room crashed upwards
into its own ceiling ...
Slartibartfast was standing in front of Arthur holding the two
wires.
"End of the tape," he explained.
"Zaphod! Wake up!"
"Mmmmmwwwwwerrrrr?"
"Hey come on, wake up."
"Just let me stick to what I'm good at, yeah?" muttered Zaphod
and rolled away from the voice back to sleep.
"Do you want me to kick you?" said Ford.
"Would it give you a lot of pleasure?" said Zaphod, blearily.
"No."
"Nor me. So what's the point? Stop bugging me." Zaphod curled
himself up.
"He got a double dose of the gas," said Trillian looking down at
him, "two windpipes."
"And stop talking," said Zaphod, "it's hard enough trying to
sleep anyway. What's the matter with the ground? It's all cold
and hard."
"It's gold," said Ford.
With an amazingly balletic movement Zaphod was standing and
scanning the horizon, because that was how far the gold ground
stretched in every direction, perfectly smooth and solid. It
gleamed like ... it's impossible to say what it gleamed like
because nothing in the Universe gleams in quite the same way that
a planet of solid gold does.
"Who put all that there?" yelped Zaphod, goggle-eyed.
"Don't get excited," said Ford, "it's only a catalogue."
"A who?"
"A catalogue," said Trillian, "an illusion."
"How can you say that?" cried Zaphod, falling to his hands and
knees and staring at the ground. He poked it and prodded it with
his fingernail. It was very heavy and very slightly soft - he
could mark it with his fingernail. It was very yellow and very
shiny, and when he breathed on it his breath evaporated off it in
that very peculiar and special way that breath evaporates off
solid gold.
"Trillian and I came round a while ago," said Ford. "We shouted
and yelled till somebody came and then carried on shouting and
yelling till they got fed up and put us in their planet catalogue
to keep us busy till they were ready to deal with us. This is all
Sens-O-Tape."
Zaphod stared at him bitterly.
"Ah, shit," he said, "you wake me up from my own perfectly good
dream to show me somebody else's." He sat down in a huff.
"What's that series of valleys over there?" he said.
"Hallmark," said Ford. "We had a look."
"We didn't wake you earlier," said Trillian. "The last planet was
knee deep in fish."
"Fish?"
"Some people like the oddest things."
"And before that," said Ford, "we had platinum. Bit dull. We
thought you'd like to see this one though."
Seas of light glared at them in one solid blaze wherever they
looked.
"Very pretty," said Zaphod petulantly.
In the sky a huge green catalogue number appeared. It flickered
and changed, and when they looked around again so had the land.
As with one voice they all went, "Yuch."
The sea was purple. The beach they were on was composed of tiny
yellow and green pebbles - presumably terribly precious stones.
The mountains in the distance seemed soft and undulating with red
peaks. Nearby stood a solid silver beach table with a frilly
mauve parasol and silver tassles.
In the sky a huge sign appeared, replacing the catalogue number.
It said, Whatever your tastes, Magrathea can cater for you. We
are not proud.
And five hundred entirely naked women dropped out of the sky on
parachutes.
In a moment the scene vanished and left them in a springtime
meadow full of cows.
"Ow!" said Zaphod. "My brains!"
"You want to talk about it?" said Ford.
"Yeah, OK," said Zaphod, and all three sat down and ignored the
scenes that came and went around them.
"I figure this," said Zaphod. "Whatever happened to my mind, I
did it. And I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected
by the government screening tests. And I wasn't to know anything
about it myself. Pretty crazy, right?"
The other two nodded in agreement.
"So I reckon, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I
know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the
answer is I don't know. Obviously. But I put a few things
together and I can begin to guess. When did I decide to run for
President? Shortly after the death of President Yooden Vranx. You
remember Yooden, Ford?"
"Yeah," said Ford, "he was that guy we met when we were kids, the
Arcturan captain. He was a gas. He gave us conkers when you bust
your way into his megafreighter. Said you were the most amazing
kid he'd ever met."
"What's all this?" said Trillian.
"Ancient history," said Ford, "when we were kids together on
Betelgeuse. The Arcturan megafreighters used to carry most of the
bulky trade between the Galactic Centre and the outlying regions
The Betelgeuse trading scouts used to find the markets and the
Arcturans would supply them. There was a lot of trouble with
space pirates before they were wiped out in the Dordellis wars,
and the megafreighters had to be equipped with the most fantastic
defence shields known to Galactic science. They were real brutes
of ships, and huge. In orbit round a planet they would eclipse
the sun.
"One day, young Zaphod here decides to raid one. On a tri-jet
scooter designed for stratosphere work, a mere kid. I mean forget
it, it was crazier than a mad monkey. I went along for the ride
because I'd got some very safe money on him not doing it, and
didn't want him coming back with fake evidence. So what happens?
We got in his tri-jet which he had souped up into something
totally other, crossed three parsecs in a matter of weeks, bust
our way into a megafreighter I still don't know how, marched on
to the bridge waving toy pistols and demanded conkers. A wilder
thing I have not known. Lost me a year's pocket money. For what?
Conkers."
"The captain was this really amazing guy, Yooden Vranx," said
Zaphod. "He gave us food, booze - stuff from really weird parts
of the Galaxy - lots of conkers of course, and we had just the
most incredible time. Then he teleported us back. Into the
maximum security wing of Betelgeuse state prison. He was a cool
guy. Went on to become President of the Galaxy."
Zaphod paused.
The scene around them was currently plunged into gloom. Dark
mists swirled round them and elephantine shapes lurked
indistinctly in the shadows. The air was occasionally rent with
the sounds of illusory beings murdering other illusory beings.
Presumably enough people must have liked this sort of thing to
make it a paying proposition.
"Ford," said Zaphod quietly.
"Yeah?"
"Just before Yooden died he came to see me."
"What? You never told me."
"No."
"What did he say? What did he come to see you about?"
"He told me about the Heart of Gold. It was his idea that I
should steal it."
"His idea?"
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "and the only possible way of stealing it
was to be at the launching ceremony."
Ford gaped at him in astonishment for a moment, and then roared
with laughter.
"Are you telling me," he said, "that you set yourself up to
become President of the Galaxy just to steal that ship?"
"That's it," said Zaphod with the sort of grin that would get
most people locked away in a room with soft walls.
"But why?" said Ford. "What's so important about having it?"
"Dunno," said Zaphod, "I think if I'd consciously known what was
so important about it and what I would need it for it would have
showed up on the brain screening tests and I would never have
passed. I think Yooden told me a lot of things that are still
locked away."
"So you think you went and mucked about inside your own brain as
a result of Yooden talking to you?"
"He was a hell of a talker."
"Yeah, but Zaphod old mate, you want to look after yourself you
know."
Zaphod shrugged.
"I mean, don't you have any inkling of the reasons for all this?"
asked Ford.
Zaphod thought hard about this and doubts seemed to cross his
minds.
"No," he said at last, "I don't seem to be letting myself into
any of my secrets. Still," he added on further reflection, "I can
understand that. I wouldn't trust myself further than I could
spit a rat."
A moment later, the last planet in the catalogue vanished from
beneath them and the solid world resolved itself again.
They were sitting in a plush waiting room full of glass-top
tables and design awards.
A tall Magrathean man was standing in front of them.
"The mice will see you now," he said.
"So there you have it," said Slartibartfast, making a feeble and
perfunctory attempt to clear away some of the appalling mess of
his study. He picked up a paper from the top of a pile, but then
couldn't think of anywhere else to put it, so he but it back on
top of the original pile which promptly fell over. "Deep Thought
designed the Earth, we built it and you lived on it."
"And the Vogons came and destroyed it five minutes before the
program was completed," added Arthur, not unbitterly.
"Yes," said the old man, pausing to gaze hopelessly round the
room. "Ten million years of planning and work gone just like
that. Ten million years, Earthman ... can you conceive of that
kind of time span? A galactic civilization could grow from a
single worm five times over in that time. Gone." He paused.
"Well that's bureaucracy for you," he added.
"You know," said Arthur thoughtfully, "all this explains a lot of
things. All through my life I've had this strange unaccountable
feeling that something was going on in the world, something big,
even sinister, and no one would tell me what it was."
"No," said the old man, "that's just perfectly normal paranoia.
Everyone in the Universe has that."
"Everyone?" said Arthur. "Well, if everyone has that perhaps it
means something! Perhaps somewhere outside the Universe we know
..."
"Maybe. Who cares?" said Slartibartfast before Arthur got too
excited. "Perhaps I'm old and tired," he continued, "but I always
think that the chances of finding out what really is going on are
so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is to say hang the
sense of it and just keep yourself occupied. Look at me: I design
coastlines. I got an award for Norway."
He rummaged around in a pile of debris and pulled out a large
perspex block with his name on it and a model of Norway moulded
into it.
"Where's the sense in that?" he said. "None that I've been able
to make out. I've been doing fjords in all my life. For a
fleeting moment they become fashionable and I get a major award."
He turned it over in his hands with a shrug and tossed it aside
carelessly, but not so carelessly that it didn't land on
something soft.
"In this replacement Earth we're building they've given me Africa
to do and of course I'm doing it with all fjords again because I
happen to like them, and I'm old fashioned enough to think that
they give a lovely baroque feel to a continent. And they tell me
it's not equatorial enough. Equatorial!" He gave a hollow laugh.
"What does it matter? Science has achieved some wonderful things
of course, but I'd far rather be happy than right any day."
"And are you?"
"No. That's where it all falls down of course."
"Pity," said Arthur with sympathy. "It sounded like quite a good
lifestyle otherwise."
Somewhere on the wall a small white light flashed.
"Come," said Slartibartfast, "you are to meet the mice. Your
arrival on the planet has caused considerable excitement. It has
already been hailed, so I gather, as the third most improbable
event in the history of the Universe."
"What were the first two?"
"Oh, probably just coincidences," said Slartibartfast carelessly.
He opened the door and stood waiting for Arthur to follow.
Arthur glanced around him once more, and then down at himself, at
the sweaty dishevelled clothes he had been lying in the mud in on
Thursday morning.
"I seem to be having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," he
muttered to himself.
"I beg your pardon?" said the old man mildly.
"Oh nothing," said Arthur, "only joking."
It is of course well known that careless talk costs lives, but
the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated.
For instance, at the very moment that Arthur said "I seem to be
having tremendous difficulty with my lifestyle," a freak wormhole
opened up in the fabric of the space-time continuum and carried
his words far far back in time across almost infinite reaches of
space to a distant Galaxy where strange and warlike beings were
poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle.
The two opposing leaders were meeting for the last time.
A dreadful silence fell across the conference table as the
commander of the Vl'hurgs, resplendent in his black jewelled
battle shorts, gazed levelly at the G'Gugvuntt leader squatting
opposite him in a cloud of green sweet-smelling steam, and, with
a million sleek and horribly beweaponed star cruisers poised to
unleash electric death at his single word of command, challenged
the vile creature to take back what it had said about his mother.
The creature stirred in his sickly broiling vapour, and at that
very moment the words I seem to be having tremendous difficulty
with my lifestyle drifted across the conference table.
Unfortunately, in the Vl'hurg tongue this was the most dreadful
insult imaginable, and there was nothing for it but to wage
terrible war for centuries.
Eventually of course, after their Galaxy had been decimated over
a few thousand years, it was realized that the whole thing had
been a ghastly mistake, and so the two opposing battle fleets
settled their few remaining differences in order to launch a
joint attack on our own Galaxy - now positively identified as the
source of the offending remark.
For thousands more years the mighty ships tore across the empty
wastes of space and finally dived screaming on to the first
planet they came across - which happened to be the Earth - where
due to a terrible miscalculation of scale the entire battle fleet
was accidentally swallowed by a small dog.
Those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the
history of the Universe say that this sort of thing is going on
all the time, but that we are powerless to prevent it.
"It's just life," they say.
A short aircar trip brought Arthur and the old Magrathean to a
doorway. They left the car and went through the door into a
waiting room full of glass-topped tables and perspex awards.
Almost immediately, a light flashed above the door at the other
side of the room and they entered.
"Arthur! You're safe!" a voice cried.
"Am I?" said Arthur, rather startled. "Oh good."
The lighting was rather subdued and it took him a moment or so to
see Ford, Trillian and Zaphod sitting round a large table
beautifully decked out with exotic dishes, strange sweetmeats and
bizarre fruits. They were stuffing their faces.
"What happened to you?" demanded Arthur.
"Well," said Zaphod, attacking a boneful of grilled muscle, "our
guests here have been gassing us and zapping our minds and being
generally weird and have now given us a rather nice meal to make
it up to us. Here," he said hoiking out a lump of evil smelling
meat from a bowl, "have some Vegan Rhino's cutlet. It's delicious
if you happen to like that sort of thing."
"Hosts?" said Arthur. "What hosts? I don't see any ..."
A small voice said, "Welcome to lunch, Earth creature."
Arthur glanced around and suddenly yelped.
"Ugh!" he said. "There are mice on the table!"
There was an awkward silence as everyone looked pointedly at
Arthur.
He was busy staring at two white mice sitting in what looked like
whisky glasses on the table. He heard the silence and glanced
around at everyone.
"Oh!" he said, with sudden realization. "Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't
quite prepared for ..."
"Let me introduce you," said Trillian. "Arthur this is Benji
mouse."
"Hi," said one of the mice. His whiskers stroked what must have
been a touch sensitive panel on the inside of the whisky-glass
like affair, and it moved forward slightly.
"And this is Frankie mouse."
The other mouse said, "Pleased to meet you," and did likewise.
Arthur gaped.
"But aren't they ..."
"Yes," said Trillian, "they are the mice I brought with me from
the Earth."
She looked him in the eye and Arthur thought he detected the
tiniest resigned shrug.
"Could you pass me that bowl of grated Arcturan Megadonkey?" she
said.
Slartibartfast coughed politely.
"Er, excuse me," he said.
"Yes, thank you Slartibartfast," said Benji mouse sharply, "you
may go."
"What? Oh ... er, very well," said the old man, slightly taken
aback, "I'll just go and get on with some of my fjords then."
"Ah, well in fact that won't be necessary," said Frankie mouse.
"It looks very much as if we won't be needing the new Earth any
longer." He swivelled his pink little eyes. "Not now that we have
found a native of the planet who was there seconds before it was
destroyed."
"What?" cried Slartibartfast, aghast. "You can't mean that! I've
got a thousand glaciers poised and ready to roll over Africa!"
"Well perhaps you can take a quick skiing holiday before you
dismantle them," said Frankie, acidly.
"Skiing holiday!" cried the old man. "Those glaciers are works of
art! Elegantly sculptured contours, soaring pinnacles of ice,
deep majestic ravines! It would be sacrilege to go skiing on high
art!"
"Thank you Slartibartfast," said Benji firmly. "That will be
all."
"Yes sir," said the old man coldly, "thank you very much. Well,
goodbye Earthman," he said to Arthur, "hope the lifestyle comes
together."
With a brief nod to the rest of the company he turned and walked
sadly out of the room.
Arthur stared after him not knowing what to say.
"Now," said Benji mouse, "to business."
Ford and Zaphod clinked their glasses together.
"To business!" they said.
"I beg your pardon?" said Benji.
Ford looked round.
"Sorry, I thought you were proposing a toast," he said.
The two mice scuttled impatiently around in their glass
transports. Finally they composed themselves, and Benji moved
forward to address Arthur.
"Now, Earth creature," he said, "the situation we have in effect
is this. We have, as you know, been more or less running your
planet for the last ten million years in order to find this
wretched thing called the Ultimate Question."
"Why?" said Arthur, sharply.
"No - we already thought of that one," said Frankie interrupting,
"but it doesn't fit the answer. Why? - Forty-Two ... you see, it
doesn't work."
"No," said Arthur, "I mean why have you been doing it?"
"Oh, I see," said Frankie. "Well, eventually just habit I think,
to be brutally honest. And this is more or less the point - we're
sick to the teeth with the whole thing, and the prospect of doing
it all over again on account of those whinnet-ridden Vogons quite
frankly gives me the screaming heeby jeebies, you know what I
mean? It was by the merest lucky chance that Benji and I finished
our particular job and left the planet early for a quick holiday,
and have since manipulated our way back to Magrathea by the good
offices of your friends."
"Magrathea is a gateway back to our own dimension," put in Benji.
"Since when," continued his murine colleague, "we have had an
offer of a quite enormously fat contract to do the D chat show
and lecture circuit back in our own dimensional neck of the
woods, and we're very much inclined to take it."
"I would, wouldn't you Ford?" said Zaphod promptingly.
"Oh yes," said Ford, "jump at it, like a shot."
Arthur glanced at them, wondering what all this was leading up
to.
"But we've got to have a product you see," said Frankie, "I mean
ideally we still need the Ultimate Question in some form or
other."
Zaphod leaned forward to Arthur.
"You see," he said, "if they're just sitting there in the studio
looking very relaxed and, you know, just mentioning that they
happen to know the Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything,
and then eventually have to admit that in fact it's Forty-two,
then the show's probably quite short. No follow-up, you see."
"We have to have something that sounds good," said Benji.
"Something that sounds good?" exclaimed Arthur. "An Ultimate
Question that sounds good? From a couple of mice?"
The mice bristled.
"Well, I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research,
yes the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a
point I'm afraid where you begin to suspect that if there's any
real truth, it's that the entire multi-dimensional infinity of
the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs.
And if it comes to a choice between spending yet another ten
million years finding that out, and on the other hand just taking
the money and running, then I for one could do with the
exercise," said Frankie.
"But ..." started Arthur, hopelessly.
"Hey, will you get this, Earthman," interrupted Zaphod. "You are
a last generation product of that computer matrix, right, and you
were there right up to the moment your planet got the finger,
yeah?"
"Er ..."
"So your brain was an organic part of the penultimate
configuration of the computer programme," said Ford, rather
lucidly he thought.
"Right?" said Zaphod.
"Well," said Arthur doubtfully. He wasn't aware of ever having
felt an organic part of anything. He had always seen this as one
of his problems.
"In other words," said Benji, steering his curious little vehicle
right over to Arthur, "there's a good chance that the structure
of the question is encoded in the structure of your brain - so we
want to buy it off you."
"What, the question?" said Arthur.
"Yes," said Ford and Trillian.
"For lots of money," said Zaphod.
"No, no," said Frankie, "it's the brain we want to buy."
"What!"
"I thought you said you could just read his brain
electronically," protested Ford.
"Oh yes," said Frankie, "but we'd have to get it out first. It's
got to be prepared."
"Treated," said Benji.
"Diced."
"Thank you," shouted Arthur, tipping up his chair and backing
away from the table in horror.
"It could always be replaced," said Benji reasonably, "if you
think it's important."
"Yes, an electronic brain," said Frankie, "a simple one would
suffice."
"A simple one!" wailed Arthur.
"Yeah," said Zaphod with a sudden evil grin, "you'd just have to
program it to say What? and I don't understand and Where's the
tea? - who'd know the difference?"
"What?" cried Arthur, backing away still further.
"See what I mean?" said Zaphod and howled with pain because of
something that Trillian did at that moment.
"I'd notice the difference," said Arthur.
"No you wouldn't," said Frankie mouse, "you'd be programmed not
to."
Ford made for the door.
"Look, I'm sorry, mice old lads," he said. "I don't think we've
got a deal."
"I rather think we have to have a deal," said the mice in chorus,
all the charm vanishing fro their piping little voices in an
instant. With a tiny whining shriek their two glass transports
lifted themselves off the table, and swung through the air
towards Arthur, who stumbled further backwards into a blind
corner, utterly unable to cope or think of anything.
Trillian grabbed him desperately by the arm and tried to drag him
towards the door, which Ford and Zaphod were struggling to open,
but Arthur was dead weight - he seemed hypnotized by the airborne
rodents swooping towards him.
She screamed at him, but he just gaped.
With one more yank, Ford and Zaphod got the door open. On the
other side of it was a small pack of rather ugly men who they
could only assume were the heavy mob of Magrathea. Not only were
they ugly themselves, but the medical equipment they carried with
them was also far from pretty. They charged.
So - Arthur was about to have his head cut open, Trillian was
unable to help him, and Ford and Zaphod were about to be set upon
by several thugs a great deal heavier and more sharply armed than
they were.
All in all it was extremely fortunate that at that moment every
alarm on the planet burst into an earsplitting din.
"Emergency! Emergency!" blared the klaxons throughout Magrathea.
"Hostile ship has landed on planet. Armed intruders in section
A. Defence stations, defence stations!"
The two mice sniffed irritably round the fragments of their glass
transports where they lay shattered on the floor.
"Damnation," muttered Frankie mouse, "all that fuss over two
pounds of Earthling brain." He scuttled round and about, his pink
eyes flashing, his fine white coat bristling with static.
"The only thing we can do now," said Benji, crouching and
stroking his whiskers in thought, "is to try and fake a question,
invent one that will sound plausible."
"Difficult," said Frankie. He thought. "How about What's yellow
and dangerous?"
Benji considered this for a moment.
"No, no good," he said. "Doesn't fit the answer."
They sank into silence for a few seconds.
"Alright," said Benji. "What do you get if you multiply six by
seven?"
"No, no, too literal, too factual," said Frankie, "wouldn't
sustain the punters' interest."
Again they thought.
Then Frankie said: "Here's a thought. How many roads must a man
walk down?"
"Ah," said Benji. "Aha, now that does sound promising!" He rolled
the phrase around a little. "Yes," he said, "that's excellent!
Sounds very significant without actually tying you down to
meaning anything at all. How many roads must a man walk down?
Forty-two. Excellent, excellent, that'll fox 'em. Frankie baby,
we are made!"
They performed a scampering dance in their excitement.
Near them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who had been
hit about the head with some heavy design awards.
Half a mile away, four figures pounded up a corridor looking for
a way out. They emerged into a wide open-plan computer bay. They
glanced about wildly.
"Which way do you reckon Zaphod?" said Ford.
"At a wild guess, I'd say down here," said Zaphod, running off
down to the right between a computer bank and the wall. As the
others started after him he was brought up short by a Kill-O-Zap
energy bolt that cracked through the air inches in front of him
and fried a small section of adjacent wall.
A voice on a loud hailer said, "OK Beeblebrox, hold it right
there. We've got you covered."
"Cops!" hissed Zaphod, and span around in a crouch. "You want to
try a guess at all, Ford?"
"OK, this way," said Ford, and the four of them ran down a
gangway between two computer banks.
At the end of the gangway appeared a heavily armoured and space-
suited figure waving a vicious Kill-O-Zap gun.
"We don't want to shoot you, Beeblebrox!" shouted the figure.
"Suits me fine!" shouted Zaphod back and dived down a wide gap
between two data process units.
The others swerved in behind him.
"There are two of them," said Trillian. "We're cornered."
They squeezed themselves down in an angle between a large
computer data bank and the wall.
They held their breath and waited.
Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops
opened fire on them simultaneously.
"Hey, they're shooting at us," said Arthur, crouching in a tight
ball, "I thought they said they didn't want to do that."
"Yeah, I thought they said that," agreed Ford.
Zaphod stuck a head up for a dangerous moment.
"Hey," he said, "I thought you said you didn't want to shoot us!"
and ducked again.
They waited.
After a moment a voice replied, "It isn't easy being a cop!"
"What did he say?" whispered Ford in astonishment.
"He said it isn't easy being a cop."
"Well surely that's his problem isn't it?"
"I'd have thought so."
Ford shouted out, "Hey listen! I think we've got enough problems
on our own having you shooting at us, so if you could avoid
laying your problems on us as well, I think we'd all find it
easier to cope!"
Another pause, and then the loud hailer again.
"Now see here, guy," said the voice on the loud hailer, "you're
not dealing with any dumb two-bit trigger-pumping morons with low
hairlines, little piggy eyes and no conversation, we're a couple
of intelligent caring guys that you'd probably quite like if you
met us socially! I don't go around gratuitously shooting people
and then bragging about it afterwards in seedy space-rangers
bars, like some cops I could mention! I go around shooting people
gratuitously and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to
my girlfriend!"
"And I write novels!" chimed in the other cop. "Though I haven't
had any of them published yet, so I better warn you, I'm in a
meeeean mood!"
Ford's eyes popped halfway out of their sockets. "Who are these
guys?" he said.
"Dunno," said Zaphod, "I think I preferred it when they were
shooting."
"So are you going to come quietly," shouted one of the cops
again, "or are you going to let us blast you out?"
"Which would you prefer?" shouted Ford.
A millisecond later the air about them started to fry again, as
bolt after bolt of Kill-O-Zap hurled itself into the computer
bank in front of them.
The fusillade continued for several seconds at unbearable
intensity.
When it stopped, there were a few seconds of near quietness ad
the echoes died away.
"You still there?" called one of the cops.
"Yes," they called back.
"We didn't enjoy doing that at all," shouted the other cop.
"We could tell," shouted Ford.
"Now, listen to this, Beeblebrox, and you better listen good!"
"Why?" shouted Back Zaphod.
"Because," shouted the cop, "it's going to be very intelligent,
and quite interesting and humane! Now either you all give
yourselves up now and let us beat you up a bit, though not very
much of course because we are firmly opposed to needless
violence, or we blow up this entire planet and possibly one or
two others we noticed on our way out here!"
"But that's crazy!" cried Trillian. "You wouldn't do that!"
"Oh yes we would," shouted the cop, "wouldn't we?" he asked the
other one.
"Oh yes, we'd have to, no question," the other one called back.
"But why?" demanded Trillian.
"Because there are some things you have to do even if you are an
enlightened liberal cop who knows all about sensitivity and
everything!"
"I just don't believe these guys," muttered Ford, shaking his
head.
One cop shouted to the other, "Shall we shoot them again for a
bit?"
"Yeah, why not?"
They let fly another electric barrage.
The heat and noise was quite fantastic. Slowly, the computer bank
was beginning to disintegrate. The front had almost all melted
away, and thick rivulets of molten metal were winding their way
back towards where they were squatting. They huddled further back
and waited for the end.
But the end never came, at least not then.
Quite suddenly the barrage stopped, and the sudden silence
afterwards was punctuated by a couple of strangled gurgles and
thuds.
The four stared at each other.
"What happened?" said Arthur.
"They stopped," said Zaphod with a shrug.
"Why?"
"Dunno, do you want to go and ask them?"
"No."
They waited.
"Hello?" called out Ford.
No answer.
"That's odd."
"Perhaps it's a trap."
"They haven't the wit."
"What were those thuds?"
"Dunno."
They waited for a few more seconds.
"Right," said Ford, "I'm going to have a look."
He glanced round at the others.
"Is no one going to say, No you can't possibly, let me go
instead?"
They all shook their heads.
"Oh well," he said, and stood up.
For a moment, nothing happened.
Then, after a second or so, nothing continued to happen. Ford
peered through the thick smoke that was billowing out of the
burning computer.
Cautiously he stepped out into the open.
Still nothing happened.
Twenty yards away he could dimly see through the smoke the
space-suited figure of one of the cops. He was lying in a
crumpled heap on the ground. Twenty yards in the other direction
lay the second man. No one else was anywhere to be seen.
This struck Ford as being extremely odd.
Slowly, nervously, he walked towards the first one. The body lay
reassuringly still as he approached it, and continued to lie
reassuringly still as he reached it and put his foot down on the
Kill-O-Zap gun that still dangled from its limp fingers.
He reached down and picked it up, meeting no resistance.
The cop was quite clearly dead.
A quick examination revealed him to be from Blagulon Kappa - he
was a methane-breathing life form, dependent on his space suit
for survival in the thin oxygen atmosphere of Magrathea.
The tiny life-support system computer on his backpack appeared
unexpectedly to have blown up.
Ford poked around in it in considerable astonishment. These
miniature suit computers usually had the full back-up of the main
computer back on the ship, with which they were directly linked
through the sub-etha. Such a system was fail-safe in all
circumstances other than total feedback malfunction, which was
unheard of.
He hurried over to the other prone figure, and discovered that
exactly the same impossible thing had happened to him, presumably
simultaneously.
He called the others over to look. They came, shared his
astonishment, but not his curiosity.
"Let's get shot out of this hole," said Zaphod. "If whatever I'm
supposed to be looking for is here, I don't want it." He grabbed
the second Kill-O-Zap gun, blasted a perfectly harmless
accounting computer and rushed out into the corridor, followed by
the others. He very nearly blasted hell out of an aircar that
stood waiting for them a few yards away.
The aircar was empty, but Arthur recognized it as belonging to
Slartibartfast.
It had a note from him pinned to part of its sparse instrument
panel. The note had an arrow drawn on it, pointing at one of the
controls.
It said, This is probably the best button to press.
The aircar rocketed them at speeds in excess of R through the
steel tunnels that lead out onto the appalling surface of the
planet which was now in the grip of yet another drear morning
twilight. Ghastly grey lights congealed on the land.
R is a velocity measure, defined as a reasonable speed of travel
that is consistent with health, mental wellbeing and not being
more than say five minutes late. It is therefore clearly an
almost infinitely variable figure according to circumstances,
since the first two factors vary not only with speed taken as an
absolute, but also with awareness of the third factor. Unless
handled with tranquility this equation can result in considerable
stress, ulcers and even death.
R is not a fixed velocity, but it is clearly far too fast.
The aircar flung itself through the air at R and above,
deposited them next to the Heart of Gold which stood starkly on
the frozen ground like a bleached bone, and then precipitately
hurled itself back in the direction whence they had come,
presumably on important business of its own.
Shivering, the four of them stood and looked at the ship.
Beside it stood another one.
It was the Blagulon Kappa policecraft, a bulbous sharklike
affair, slate green in colour and smothered with black stencilled
letters of varying degrees of size and unfriendliness. The
letters informed anyone who cared to read them as to where the
ship was from, what section of the police it was assigned to, and
where the power feeds should be connected.
It seemed somehow unnaturally dark and silent, even for a ship
whose two-man crew was at that moment lying asphyxicated in a
smoke-filled chamber several miles beneath the ground. It is one
of those curious things that is impossible to explain or define,
but one can sense when a ship is completely dead.
Ford could sense it and found it most mysterious - a ship and two
policemen seemed to have gone spontaneously dead. In his
experience the Universe simply didn't work like that.
The other three could sense it too, but they could sense the
bitter cold even more and hurried back into the Heart of Gold
suffering from an acute attack of no curiosity.
Ford stayed, and went to examine the Blagulon ship. As he walked,
he nearly tripped over an inert steel figure lying face down in
the cold dust.
"Marvin!" he exclaimed. "What are you doing?"
"Don't feel you have to take any notice of me, please," came a
muffled drone.
"But how are you, metalman?" said Ford.
"Very depressed."
"What's up?"
"I don't know," said Marvin, "I've never been there."
"Why," said Ford squatting down beside him and shivering, "are
you lying face down in the dust?"
"It's a very effective way of being wretched," said Marvin.
"Don't pretend you want to talk to me, I know you hate me."
"No I don't."
"Yes you do, everybody does. It's part of the shape of the
Universe. I only have to talk to somebody and they begin to hate
me. Even robots hate me. If you just ignore me I expect I shall
probably go away."
He jacked himself up to his feet and stood resolutely facing the
opposite direction.
"That ship hated me," he said dejectedly, indicating the
policecraft.
"That ship?" said Ford in sudden excitement. "What happened to
it? Do you know?"
"It hated me because I talked to it."
"You talked to it?" exclaimed Ford. "What do you mean you talked
to it?"
"Simple. I got very bored and depressed, so I went and plugged
myself in to its external computer feed. I talked to the computer
at great length and explained my view of the Universe to it,"
said Marvin.
"And what happened?" pressed Ford.
"It committed suicide," said Marvin and stalked off back to the
Heart of Gold.
That night, as the Heart of Gold was busy putting a few light
years between itself and the Horsehead Nebula, Zaphod lounged
under the small palm tree on the bridge trying to bang his brain
into shape with massive Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters; Ford and
Trillian sat in a corner discussing life and matters arising from
it; and Arthur took to his bed to flip through Ford's copy of The
Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Since he was going to live in
the place, he reasoned, he'd better start finding out something
about it.
He came across this entry.
It said: 'The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends
to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of
Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How,
Why and Where phases.
"For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question
How can we eat? the second by the question Why do we eat? and the
third by the question Where shall we have lunch?"
He got no further before the ship's intercom buzzed into life.
"Hey Earthman? You hungry kid?" said Zaphod's voice.
"Er, well yes, a little peckish I suppose," said Arthur.
"OK baby, hold tight," said Zaphod. "We'll take in a quick bite
at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."
The term Imperial is kept though it is now an anachronism. The
hereditary Emperor is nearly dead and has been so for many
centuries. In the last moments of his dying coma he was locked in
a statis field which keeps him in a state of perpetual
unchangingness. All his heirs are now long dead, and this means
that without any drastic political upheaval, power has simply and
effectively moved a rung or two down the ladder, and is now seen
to be vested in a body which used to act simply as advisers to
the Emperor - an elected Governmental assembly headed by a
President elected by that assembly. In fact it vests in no such
place.
The President in particular is very much a figurehead - he wields
no real power whatsoever. He is apparently chosen by the
government, but the qualities he is required to display are not
those of leadership but those of finely judged outrage. For this
reason the President is always a controversial choice, always an
infuriating but fascinating character. His job is not to wield
power but to draw attention away from it. On those criteria
Zaphod Beeblebrox is one of the most successful Presidents the
Galaxy has ever had - he has already spent two of his ten
Presidential years in prison for fraud. Very very few people
realize that the President and the Government have virtually no
power at all, and of these very few people only six know whence
ultimate political power is wielded. Most of the others secretly
believe that the ultimate decision-making process is handled by a
computer. They couldn't be more wrong.
Ford Prefect's original name is only pronuncible in an obscure
Betelgeusian dialect, now virtually extinct since the Great
Collapsing Hrung Disaster which wiped out
all the old Praxibetel communities on Betelgeuse Seven. Ford's
father was the only man on the entire planet to survive the Great
Collapsing Hrung disaster, by an extraordinary coincidence that
he was never able satisfactorily to explain. The whole episode is
shrouded in deep mystery: in fact no one ever knew what a Hrung
was nor why it had chosen to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven
particularly. Ford's father, magnanimously waving aside the
clouds of suspicion that had inevitably settled around him, came
to live on Betelgeuse Five where he both fathered and uncled
Ford; in memory of his now dead race he christened him in the
ancient Praxibetel tongue.
Because Ford never learned to say his original name, his father
eventually died of shame, which is still a terminal disease in
some parts of the Galaxy. The other kids at school nicknamed him
Ix, which in the language of Betelgeuse Five translates as "boy
who is not able satisfactorily to explain what a Hrung is, nor
why it should choose to collapse on Betelgeuse Seven".
